pnglite

About
pnglite is a C library for loading PNG images. It was created as a substitute for libpng in situations 
when libpng is more than enough. It currently requires zlib for inflate and crc checking and it can read 
the most common types of PNG images. The library has a small and simple to use interface.

As of 0.1.17 pnglite also supports writing PNG images.

Features
Current supported PNG images are truecolor, trucolor with alpha, greyscale and greyscale with alpha. All of 
these can be read with 8 or 16 bit color depth. No interlacing is supported at the moment.

License
pnglite is distributed under the libpng/zlib license. See pnglite.h for further details.
