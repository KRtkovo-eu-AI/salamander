<h1>Advanced Options</h1>

<p>Use this dialog to set options for comparing files. You can choose if to use these options
only for the current comparison or set them as defaults. You can preset these options
also on <a href="config_defcompopts.htm">Default Compare Options</a> tab in Configuration
dialog.</p>

<h4>Options</h4>
<dl>
<dt><i>Ignores: All white space</i> (only when comparing text files)</dt>

<dd>When checked, the file comparator ignores all horizontal and vertical white space characters
(space, tab, end of line). You can imagine that it removes all white space characters
before it starts any other actions.
</dd>

<dt><i>Ignores: Changes in the amount of white space</i> (only when comparing text files)</dt>

<dd>When checked, the file comparator ignores all changes in horizontal and vertical white
space characters (space, tab, end of line). You can imagine that it replaces every sequence of
white space characters by a single space character before it starts any other actions.
</dd>

<dt><i>Ignores: Case</i> (only when comparing text files)</dt>

<dd>When checked, the file comparator ignores case (upper and lower case
characters are equivalent).
</dd>

<dt><i>Files type: Autodetect, Text, or Binary</i></dt>

<dd>If you choose autodetect, both files will be tested if they are text files.
If yes, they will be compared as text files. Otherwise they will be compared as
binary files. If you don't want the files types to be autodetected, select if the plugin
should compare them as text or as binary files.
</dd>

<dt><i>Encoding of text files</i></dt>

<dd>You can let File Comparator autodetect the encoding (or code page) of the compared files
when comparing as text files. Or you can choose one of several encodings and conversions.<br/>
There are 2 groups of available options:
<ul>
<li>ASCII-8: Conversions between several various encodings (code pages) of one of 3&nbsp;groups of languages:
Central European, Cyrillic and Western European. Only 1&nbsp;group is available at a time.
It is the same group as in the Internal Viewer of Open Salamander. Another group can be chosen
in the <a href="ms-its:salamand.chm::/hh/salamand/configuration_reg.htm">Language page in Configuration</a>
of Open Salamander as <i>Code page conversion tables</i>.<br/>
When a conversion is selected, the entire file is first converted in memory and then compared with the other file.<br/>
Choosing a conversion is suitable when comparing files in different encodings. Otherwise usually
no conversion is needed. For better (correct) display, it is advisable to convert both files
either to CP12xx or ASCII codepage.
<li>Unicode: Various Unicode encodings
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><i>Line ends</i> (only when comparing text files)</dt>

<dd>Choose what types of line ends should be recognized in the first and second file.
</dd>

<dt><i>Combine diacritic marks to precomposed characters</i></dt>

<dd>Many accented characters can be represented in several ways in Unicode. Either as a pair (or triple)
of characters (the unaccented version of the character plus the accent(s), this is called decomposed or composite character)
or as a single character (precomposed character). While on Windows the precomposed form is the usual
one, files originating on other operating systems can use the decomposed form. Both forms are equivalent in terms
of rendering, but stored differently.<br/> When this option is checked, File Comparator on Unicode input files attempts to convert
decomposed characters to precomposed ones to achieve so called <i>Normalization Form C</i> of Unicode.
The Form C allows comparison of the content rather than the way the text is stored.<br/>
NOTE: Not every decomposed pair or triple has its precomposed equivalent.<br/>
NOTE: This function is available only on systems that contain a system library called <i>normaliz.dll</i>.
It is a part of Windows Vista and newer OS versions, but is also part of MSIE 7 or Windows Media Player 11 when
installed on Windows XP or 2003. It can also be installed separately as <i>Microsoft Internationalized Domain Names</i>
(idndlpackage.EXE) from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download" target="_blank">Microsoft downloads</a>.</dd>

<dt><i>Use these settings in future comparisons</i></dt>

<dd>When checked, options will be saved as defaults and will be used for all future
comparisons. Otherwise these options are used only for the current comparison.
</dd>
