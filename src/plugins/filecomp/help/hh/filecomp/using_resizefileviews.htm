<h1>Resizing File Views</h1>

<p>Compared files are displayed side-by-side. You can change the size of the
file views by dragging the Split bar between the views or right-click the
Split bar and choose a ratio from the context menu. When you double click the Split
bar, both views will have the same size. You can also use the following commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maximize Left (Top) File View (the Ctrl+, key): maximize the left (top) file view (right (bottom) view is minimized),</li>
<li>Maximize Right (Bottom) File View (the Ctrl+. key): maximize the right (bottom) file view (left (top) view is minimized),</li>
<li>Size File Views Equally (the Ctrl+E key): both views will have the same size,</li>
<li>Toggle Full Screen (the F11 key): maximize the File Comparator window.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find all described commands in the File Comparator window in the View menu.</p>
