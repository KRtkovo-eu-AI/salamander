<h1>Operations 1</h1>

<p>Use this tab to set the default behaviour of file operations (copy and move from
the FTP server, change attributes on the FTP server, delete on the FTP server).</p>

<h4>Options</h4>
<dl>
<dt><b>Copy and Move from FTP server</b></dt>

<dt><i>If target file already exists</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if target file already exists. Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Use Alternate Name</td><td>Finds some alternate file name (which is not
         existing) and uses it as the new target file name.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Resume</td><td>Tries to resume copying or moving of the file. It uses already
         copied/moved part of the file, so it saves time and compensates network failures
	 during copying/moving of the file. Unfortunately not all FTP servers support
	 resuming (the REST command).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Resume or Overwrite</td><td>Tries to resume copying or moving of the file.
         If it is not possible, it overwrites the target file (it copies/moves whole file).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Overwrite</td><td>Overwrites the target file (it copies/moves whole file).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the file (the file is not copied/moved).</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>

 <tr><td>Use Alternate Name</td><td>Finds some alternate directory name (which is not
         existing) and uses it as the new target directory name.</td></tr>

         the existing directory.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the directory (the directory is not copied/moved).</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt><i>If target file name cannot be created</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if target file name cannot be created. Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Use Alternate Name</td><td>Finds some alternate file name (which is not
         existing) and uses it as the new target file name.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the file (the file is not copied/moved).</td></tr>

 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>

 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the directory (the directory is not copied/moved).</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt><i>If transfer fails, how to retry it in case target file was created</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if transfer fails. The target file was created or overwritten
(not resumed). Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Use Alternate Name</td><td>Finds some alternate file name (which is not
         existing) and uses it as the new target file name (it copies/moves whole file again).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Resume</td><td>Tries to resume copying or moving of the file. It uses already
         copied/moved part of the file, so it saves time and compensates network failures
	 during copying/moving of the file. Unfortunatelly not all FTP servers support
	 resuming (the REST command).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Resume or Overwrite</td><td>Tries to resume copying or moving of the file.

 <tr><td>Overwrite</td><td>Overwrites the target file (it copies/moves whole file again).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the file (only a part of the file was copied/moved).</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt><i>If transfer fails, how to retry it in case target file was resumed</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if transfer fails. The target file was resumed (in fact it would not
have to be resumed if the size of already copied/moved part of file was smaller than specified
minimum, see <i>Try to resume copying only if already copied part of file is at least XXX bytes</i>
in <a href="config_advanced.htm">Configuration/Advanced</a>). Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Use Alternate Name</td><td>Finds some alternate file name (which is not
         existing) and uses it as the new target file name (it copies/moves whole file again).</td></tr>

 <tr><td>Overwrite</td><td>Overwrites the target file (it copies/moves whole file again).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the file (only a part of the file was copied/moved).</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt><i>If ASCII transfer mode is set for file with binary content</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if ASCII transfer mode is set for the file with binary content
(the file type is detected from the first 10 KB of the file). If the file has binary
content, the possible conversion of end of line characters will probably corrupt
the file. Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Ignore</td><td>Ignores this warning, the file copying/moving is finished
	 in ASCII transfer mode. Use this action only if you are sure that it is
	 a plain text file.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Use Binary Mode</td><td>It copies/moves the whole file again in Binary transfer mode.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the file (the file is not copied/moved).</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt><b>Change Attributes on FTP server</b></dt>

<dt><i>If existing attributes cannot be preserved (e.g. Unix 's' mode)</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if existing access rights (attributes) cannot be preserved. For example
if you want to set Read and Write and preserve Execute owner rights for file with
'r-s------' rights on Unix. The problem is that the FTP client can set only
basic Unix rights ('rwxrwxrwx') and cannot modify only part of these rights.
See <a href="using_changeattrs.htm">Changing Access Rights</a> for details.
Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Ignore</td><td>Ignores this problem, only basic access rights are set to
         the file. It means that existing rights (attributes) are not preserved (e.g.
	 in preceding example it will set 'rwx------' instead of 'rws------').</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the file (the file access rights are not changed).</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt><b>Delete on FTP server</b></dt>

<dt><i>If directory is not empty</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if directory is not empty. Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Delete</td><td>Deletes the directory (including its content).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the directory (the directory is not deleted).</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt><i>If file is hidden</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if file is hidden. Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Delete</td><td>Deletes the file.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the file (the file is not deleted).</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt><i>If directory is hidden</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if directory is hidden. Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Delete</td><td>Deletes the directory (including its content).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the directory (the directory is not deleted).</td></tr>
</table>
