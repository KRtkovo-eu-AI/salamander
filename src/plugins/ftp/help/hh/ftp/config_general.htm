<h1>General</h1>

<p>Use this tab to change the general behavior of the FTP Client plugin.
See <a href="ms-its:salamand.chm::/hh/salamand/plugins_config.htm">Configuring Plugins</a>
for general information about configuration.</p>

<h4>Options</h4>
<dl>
<dt><i>Show window with welcome message from server after connect</i></dt>
<dd>Clear this check box if you do not want to see a window with a welcome message from
the FTP server immediately after you connect to it. The message contains communication
between the client and server up to successful login reply from server (you can find
this communication also in the FTP log). Usually this message contains general rules
on the server, number of connected clients, etc.
</dd>

<dt><i>Accept hex escape sequences in paths (known from web browsers, e.g. "%20" to " ")</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, hex escape sequences are accepted (known from web browsers, e.g. "%20" to " ")
in the <i>Address</i> box in the <a href="dlgboxes_connect.htm">Connect to FTP Server
dialog box</a>. Otherwise these sequences are ignored (not translated).
</dd>

<dt><i>Close operation dialog automatically when operation is successfully finished in untouched dialog</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, the <a href="dlgboxes_operationdlg.htm">Operation dialog box</a> is
closed automatically when operation is successfully finished and you are not working with
this dialog box (e.g. click some buttons or even only change focus). It closes this
dialog box only if there is nothing important to see in it. Otherwise, you always have to
close this dialog box manually.
</dd>

<dt><i>Open Solve Error dialogs for errors automatically if operation dialog is idle</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, the plugin opens automatically the <a href="dlgboxes_solveerror.htm">Solve
Error dialog boxes</a>. It opens these dialog boxes for all errors one by one and only if
you are not currently working in the <a href="dlgboxes_operationdlg.htm">Operation
dialog box</a>. It should simplify error handling in the Operation dialog box. Otherwise, you
have to open Solve Error dialog boxes manually (using the Solve Error button).
</dd>

<dt><i>Password for anonymous connections (your e-mail)</i></dt>
<dd>You can specify your email address here. It is used as a password for annomynous
connections to public FTP servers (they usually require it but do not check it).
</dd>
