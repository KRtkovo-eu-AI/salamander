<h1>Solve Error Dialog Boxes</h1>

<p>Use these dialog boxes to solve errors in operations, to answer confirmations and
user prompts in operations, and to retry skipped operations. You can see the list of
Solve Error dialog boxes in Remarks section. Dialogs are opened from the
<a href="dlgboxes_operationdlg.htm">Operation dialog box</a> (see <i>Operations: Show
only errors, Solve Error, Retry, Skip</i> options for details).
</p>

<h4>Options</h4>

<dl>
<dt><i>Details, Error description</i></dt>
<dd>Contains additional information to help you better understand the problem.
It may be for example a system error message description or an error reply
received from the FTP server.
</dd>

<dt><i>Path, Name</i></dt>
<dd>Specifies the file or directory which is a subject of the operation.
</dd>

<dt><i>Source path, Source Name</i></dt>
<dd>Specifies the source file or directory.
</dd>

<dt><i>Target path, Target name</i></dt>
<dd>Specifies the target file or directory. Often you can change the target name.
If you rename target file or directory this way, use the Retry button to
retry the operation with the new target name.
</dd>

<dt><i>Current attributes</i></dt>
<dd>Displays the current access rights (attributes) of the file or directory which is
a subject of the operation.
</dd>

<dt><i>New attributes</i></dt>
<dd>Displays the suggested (new) access rights (attributes) for the file or directory which is
a subject of the operation.
</dd>

<dt><i>Remember choice and do not show this dialog again for operations with the same error</i></dt>
<dd>All operations with the same error (or the same confirmation or user prompt) in the
current <a href="dlgboxes_operationdlg.htm">Operation dialog box</a> will be solved
automatically in the same way as this operation (e.g. if this operation is skipped, all
others will be skipped too).
Note: this applies to all operations already in the same error state and also to all operations
which will get to the same error state in the future.
</dd>

<dt><i>Apply to operations with the same error now</i></dt>
<dd>All operations already in the same error state (or with the same confirmation or user prompt)
in the current <a href="dlgboxes_operationdlg.htm">Operation dialog box</a> will be solved
in the same way as this operation (e.g. if this operation is skipped, all others will be
skipped too). Note: it does not apply to operations which will get to the same error state
in the future.
</dd>

<dt><b>Buttons / Commands</b> (commands are in drop-down menu on the default button)</dt>

<dt><i>Retry</i></dt>
<dd>Use this button to process the operation again. You can use it if you think that
this time the operation will succeed (e.g. you have removed some file in the way)
or if you need to rename target file or directory (you must change its name in the
Target Name edit box first).
</dd>

<dt><i>Skip</i></dt>
<dd>Use this button to skip the operation.
</dd>

<dt><i>Cancel</i></dt>
<dd>Use this button to close this dialog box (you can solve this error later). If you
want to cancel whole operation, use the Cancel button in the
<a href="dlgboxes_operationdlg.htm">Operation dialog box</a>. If you want to skip this
operation, use the Skip button.
</dd>

<dt><i>Use Existing Directory</i></dt>
<dd>Use this command to copy/move to existing target directory. See <i>If target directory
already exists</i> options in <a href="config_operation1.htm">Configuration/Operations 1</a> and
<a href="config_operation2.htm">Configuration/Operations 2</a> for details.
</dd>

<dt><i>Use Alternate Name</i></dt>
<dd>This command finds some alternate target name (which is not existing) and copies/moves
file or directory to this name.
</dd>

<dt><i>Resume</i></dt>
<dd>Use this command to resume copying or moving of a file. It is useful when copying
or moving was broken (e.g. when connection to the FTP server is lost) and you want to
continue in copying or moving at the point where it was broken (instead of copying or
moving whole file again). It can save a lot of time.
</dd>

<dt><i>Overwrite</i></dt>
<dd>Use this button to overwrite the existing target file.
</dd>

<dt><i>Overwrite All</i></dt>
<dd>Use this button to overwrite the existing target file. Moreover it selects the
<i>Remember choice and do not show this dialog again for operations with the same error</i>
option (see its description above).
</dd>

<dt><i>Resume or Overwrite</i></dt>
<dd>This command tries to resume copying or moving of a file (see <i>Resume</i> above
for details) and if it is not possible (e.g. the FTP server does not support it), it
overwrites the existing target file (it copies or moves whole file again).
</dd>

<dt><i>Ignore</i></dt>
<dd>Use this button to ignore the warning (e.g. that some of existing attributes cannot
be preserved) and continue in processing of the operation.
</dd>

<dt><i>Set New Attributes</i></dt>
<dd>Use this command to open the <a href="dlgboxes_setnewattrs.htm">Set New Attributes
dialog box</a> where you can set new access rights (attributes) for the file or directory.
</dd>

<dt><i>Delete</i></dt>
<dd>Use this button to confirm delete operation (e.g. allow deleting of hidden file).
</dd>

<dt><i>Mark as Deleted</i></dt>
<dd>Use this command when deleting a file or directory and this file or directory
has been already deleted (e.g. by other user or from other FTP client). The operation
will be marked as finished.
</dd>

<dt><i>Reduce File Size And Try to Resume Again</i></dt>
<dd>This command reduces file size (it cuts off the end of the file) and tries to resume
copying or moving of the file again. The file is reduced by the number of verified
bytes. See <i>Number of bytes to verify (at end of file) when resuming copying from server</i>
in <a href="config_advanced.htm">Configuration/Advanced</a>.
</dd>

<dt><i>Mark File As Successfully Uploaded</i></dt>
<dd>In some rare cases, it is not possible to test if the file was completely (successfully)
uploaded (copied to the FTP server). You can test the file manually on the FTP server
(or copy it back to this machine and then test it). Then use this command to
mark file as successfully uploaded (e.g. when you are moving the file, the source file
will be deleted only after your confirmation).

<p>Note: this can happen only if the FTP client sends a whole file over a data connection
to the FTP server and the FTP server does not confirm receiving of the file and the FTP client
is not able to test target file size (if ASCII transfer mode is used, or if file size in bytes
is not supported on the FTP server).
</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>Use Binary Mode</i></dt>
<dd>When you copy or move a file with binary content (the file type is detected from the first 10 KB
of the file) using ASCII transfer mode, the possible conversion of end of line characters will
probably corrupt the file. When this problem is detected, use this button to copy or move the file
again but using the Binary transfer mode.
</dd>
