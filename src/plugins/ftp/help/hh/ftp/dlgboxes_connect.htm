<h1>Connect to FTP Server</h1>

<p>Use this dialog to open new connection to FTP server. You can store your favourite
FTP servers to FTP bookmarks and use these bookmarks to quickly access these servers.
</p>

<h4>Options</h4>
<dl>
<dt><i>List of FTP Bookmarks</i></dt>
<dd>Contains the list of your FTP bookmarks. When you focus a bookmark, its parameters
are shown in the rest of the dialog (e.g. Address, User Name, and Initial Path). If you
do not want to use a bookmark, focus the Quick Connect item (it is always the first item)
in this list. Right click on a bookmark (or use the Shift+F10 key) to open the context
menu with available commands. Use drag&amp;drop (or Move Up/Down commands) to change
order of bookmarks.</dd>

<dt><i>Address</i></dt>
<dd>Specify the FTP server address. It can be IP address or name address. Use the drop-down
list to select previously used address. You can also enter the URL address here (format
<span class="nobr">ftp://user:password@server:port/path</span>), it will be split to user name, password,
server address, port number, and initial path (when the edit box loses focus).
</dd>

<dt><i>Initial path</i></dt>
<dd>Specify the initial path on the FTP server. When you connect to this server, the FTP
client will try to change the working directory to this path. If you do not want to use it,
leave it empty.
</dd>

<dt><i>Anonymous login</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, the FTP client will try to login anonymously to the FTP server (user
<i>anonymous</i>, password should be your email address, see <i>Password for anonymous
connections</i> in <a href="config_general.htm">Configuration/General</a>). Otherwise,
the FTP client will try to login using your user name and password.
</dd>

<dt><i>User name, Password, Save password, and Unlock</i></dt>
<dd>Specify your user name and password here. You can also leave one or both
of these edit boxes empty, the FTP client will ask you to enter these values if
the FTP server will require them during login procedure. If you want to save
the password to the bookmark, check the <i>Save password</i> check box.
IMPORTANT: You should protect your saved passwords by the Master Password otherwise
they can be easily displayed in this dialog or decrypted by malicious software that
have infiltrated your computer, see
<a href="ms-its:salamand.chm::/hh/salamand/othertask_pwdmanager.htm">Using Password Manager</a>
for more information about saved passwords and related security risks.
The <i>Unlock</i> button is displayed when you need to enter the Master Password to access
the password. To clear the inaccessible password use the <i>Clear Password</i> command from
drop-down menu on the <i>Unlock</i> button. To show the password hold the Ctrl key and right
click to the <i>Password</i> edit box.
</dd>

<dt><i>Advanced</i></dt>
<dd>Use this button to open the <a href="dlgboxes_connectadv.htm">Advanced
Options dialog box</a>. Advanced options are displayed in brief in the box
behind the Advanced button (just for quick preview).
</dd>

<dt><i>New, Rename, and Remove</i></dt>
<dd>Use these buttons to manage bookmarks. The New button allows you also to
copy parameters from the focused bookmark (duplicate bookmark).
</dd>

<dt><i>Connect</i></dt>
<dd>Use this button to open new connection to the FTP server (parameters of this
server are currently displayed in the dialog box). All changes in bookmarks will
be kept.
</dd>

<dt><i>Close</i></dt>
<dd>Use this button to close this dialog box without connecting to any FTP server.
All changes in bookmarks will be kept. If you want to lose changes made in bookmarks,
click the Cancel button.
</dd>
