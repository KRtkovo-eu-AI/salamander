<h1>Operations 2</h1>

<p>Use this tab to set the default behaviour of copy and move to the FTP server.</p>

<h4>Options</h4>
<dl>
<dt><b>Copy and Move to FTP server</b></dt>

<dt><i>If target file already exists</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if target file already exists. Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Use Alternate Name</td><td>Finds some alternate file name (which is not
         existing) and uses it as the new target file name.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Resume</td><td>Tries to resume copying or moving of the file. It uses already
         copied/moved part of the file, so it saves time and compensates network failures
	 during copying/moving of the file. Unfortunately not all FTP servers support
	 resuming (the APPE command).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Resume or Overwrite</td><td>Tries to resume copying or moving of the file.
         If it is not possible, it overwrites the target file (it copies/moves whole file).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Overwrite</td><td>Overwrites the target file (it copies/moves whole file).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the file (the file is not copied/moved).</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt><i>If target directory already exists</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if target directory already exists. Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>

 <tr><td>Use Alternate Name</td><td>Finds some alternate directory name (which is not
         existing) and uses it as the new target directory name.</td></tr>

         the existing directory.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the directory (the directory is not copied/moved).</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt><i>If target file name cannot be created</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if target file name cannot be created. Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Use Alternate Name</td><td>Finds some alternate file name (which is not
         existing) and uses it as the new target file name.</td></tr>

</dd>

<dt><i>If transfer fails, how to retry it in case target file was created</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if transfer fails. The target file was created or overwritten
(not resumed). Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Use Alternate Name</td><td>Finds some alternate file name (which is not
         existing) and uses it as the new target file name (it copies/moves whole file again).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Resume</td><td>Tries to resume copying or moving of the file. It uses already
         copied/moved part of the file, so it saves time and compensates network failures
	 during copying/moving of the file. Unfortunatelly not all FTP servers support
	 resuming (the APPE command).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Resume or Overwrite</td><td>Tries to resume copying or moving of the file.
         If it is not possible, it overwrites the target file (it copies/moves whole file again).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Overwrite</td><td>Overwrites the target file (it copies/moves whole file again).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the file (only a part of the file was copied/moved).</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt><i>If transfer fails, how to retry it in case target file was resumed</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if transfer fails. The target file was resumed (in fact it would not
have to be resumed if the size of already copied/moved part of file was smaller than specified
minimum, see <i>Try to resume copying only if already copied part of file is at least XXX bytes</i>
in <a href="config_advanced.htm">Configuration/Advanced</a>). Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>

 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the file (only a part of the file was copied/moved).</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt><i>If ASCII transfer mode is set for file with binary content</i></dt>
<dd>Specify what to do if ASCII transfer mode is set for the file with binary content
(the file type is detected from the first 10 KB of the file). If the file has binary
content, the possible conversion of end of line characters will probably corrupt
the file. Choose one of the following actions:
<table>
 <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Ask User</td><td>Displays dialog box where you can choose what to do.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Ignore</td><td>Ignores this warning, the file copying/moving is finished
	 in ASCII transfer mode. Use this action only if you are sure that it is
	 a plain text file.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Use Binary Mode</td><td>It copies/moves the whole file again in Binary transfer mode.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Skip</td><td>Skips the file (the file is not copied/moved).</td></tr>
