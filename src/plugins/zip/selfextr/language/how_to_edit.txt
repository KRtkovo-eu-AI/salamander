Editing resources for the Czech version
=======================================

Manually copy the contents of ZIP\selfextr\language\czech\main.rc
into ZIP\selfextr\edit_in_vs.rc. Leave out only two lines:
"#ifdef EXT_VER" and "#endif //EXT_VER". Check ZIP\selfextr\SELFEXTR.RC
for the code page of language\czech\main.rc (1250) and record it in
ZIP\selfextr\edit_in_vs.rc (see "#pragma code_page").

Open zip\vcproj\selfextr\selfextr.sln. Edit the resources by opening
the EditInVS project (edit_in_vs.vcproj). Copy the changes back from
ZIP\selfextr\edit_in_vs.rc to ZIP\selfextr\language\czech\main.rc.
Do not delete the original "#ifdef EXT_VER" and "#endif //EXT_VER".

Remove all dialogs from ZIP\selfextr\edit_in_vs.rc so we do not keep
redundant copies in Hg.
