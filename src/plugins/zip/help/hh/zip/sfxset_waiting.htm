<h1>Waiting for Another Application</h1>

<p>Use the <i>Wait For</i> button in the <a href="sfxset_settings.htm">Self-Extractor Settings</a>
dialog to open the Wait For dialog. This button is enabled only when unpacking to
temporary directory (<i>Extract to</i> is set to $(Temp)) and <i>Remove extracted
files</i> is checked.</p>

<p>Self-Extractor can unpack files to temporary folder. Then it can
start application specified in the Self-Extractor Settings dialog in the field
<i>Execute command or open document</i>. When the started application finishes,
self-extractor can remove temporary files and finish itself.</p>

<p>In some rare cases (some versions of Install Shield) the started
application (let's call it App1) starts another application (App2) and
finishes while the App2 is still running. In normal case the Self-Extractor
detects that the App1 has finished and because it does not know anything about the App2,
it removes the temporary files and finishes itself. To prevent this problem you can
specify the application for which the Self-Extractor should wait. You
can do it by specifying the filename of the App2 executable in the <i>Wait for</i> dialog.</p>
