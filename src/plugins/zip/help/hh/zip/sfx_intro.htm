<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Self-extracting archive is an executable file (.exe) which consists of ZIP
archive file and Self-Extractor (software to unpack/extract the archive).
In ZIP plugin you can create self-extracting archives with many useful options.</p>

<p>The main advantage is that anyone can extract files from a self-extracting
archive without need of any other software (ZIP unpacker) or knowing how to
use a separate unzip utility. Thus self-extracting archives are particularly
suited for distribution of software to beginning users who are not familiar
with the concept of ZIP archives. Or you can use it when transporting ZIP
archive to computer where needed ZIP software is probably not installed.</p>

<p>Using Self-Extractor you can compress your installation software.
After the installer is extracted, Self-Extractor starts the installation
or executes any other command you have specified. When the installation finishes,
Self-Extractor removes all temporary files.</p>
