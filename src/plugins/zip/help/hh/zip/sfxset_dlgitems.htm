<h1>Dialog Box Options</h1>

<p>The <a href="sfxset_settings.htm">Self-Extractor Settings</a> dialog contains
following options:</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Extract to</i></dt>
<dd><p>Specify the directory you want to be preset in <i>Extract to</i>
editbox in the main dialog of self-extracting archive. You can enter either
absolute or relative path. Relative path is relative to the current directory of
the opened self-extracting archive. If <i>Extract to</i> specifies non-existing
directory, user will be prompted whether to create it. To extract files to the
current directory leave this field blank.
</p>

<p>Samples of relative paths:<br/>
   Gallery\Van Gogh<br/>
   \Program Files\My Program<br/>
   ..\Pictures</p>

<p>At the beginning of the absolute path you can use one of the following
variables:<br/></p>

<table>

<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$(Temp)</td>
<td>Temporary files directory. This variable should stand
only alone (not followed by any path portion).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$(ProgFiles)</td>
<td><i>Program Files</i> directory.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$(WinDir)</td>
<td><i>Windows</i> directory.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$(SysDir)</td>
<td><i>System</i> directory.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$[variable]</td>
<td>Value of an environment variable.<br/>
Sample: $[windir]\Fonts</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$&lt;variable&gt;</td>
<td>Value of a Registry key value.<br/>
Sample: $&lt;SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ProgramFilesDir&gt;\Outlook Express</td>
</tr>
</table>
</dd>

<dt><i>Allow user to change the directory</i></dt>
<dd>Allows user to change <i>Extract to</i> directory.</dd>

<dt><i>Execute command or open document</i></dt>
<dd><p>Here you can enter command (with optional parameters), document name, or HTTP link (must start
with http://). It is executed (opened) when unpacking of the self-extracted archive
finishes. In case of command or document name you can enter absolute path or relative path
(relative to the current directory of the opened self-extracted archive).</p>
<p>Samples:<br/>
   setup.exe -x<br/>
   doc\readme.txt<br/>
   https://www.altap.cz/</p>
</dd>

<dt><i>Remove extracted files</i></dt>
<dd>Removes files extracted to the temporary directory when application
(e.g. installer) specified in <i>Execute command or open document</i> finishes. This option
is enabled only when unpacking to temporary directory (<i>Extract to</i> is set to $(Temp)) and
is useful for installation software.</dd>

<dt><i>Wait for</i></dt>
<dd>Self-extractor can also wait for other application than the one specified
in <i>Execute command or open document</i>. See <a href="sfxset_waiting.htm">Waiting
for Another Application</a> for details.</dd>

<dt><i>Texts</i></dt>
<dd>Defines texts in the optional message box and main dialog of self-extracting archive.
See <a href="sfxset_texts.htm">Self-Extractor Texts</a> dialog for details.</dd>

<dt><i><a id="language">Language</a></i></dt>
<dd>Lets you choose the language version of the created self-extracting archive.
If custom texts (texts specified in <a href="sfxset_texts.htm">Self-Extractor Texts</a>
dialog) were not changed and you change language, texts are changed
to the defaults of currently selected language.
If custom texts were changed and you change language, following action depends on
<i>When SFX language changes</i> in the <a href="usingzip_config.htm">ZIP Configuration</a>.
There are three variants: texts are changed to their default values,
texts are left unchanged, or you are prompted whether to change their values to
defaults or not.<br/>

Note: You can set values of custom texts to their defaults in <i>Options</i> menu or in the
Self-Extractor Texts dialog.</dd>

<dt><i>Icon</i></dt>
<dd>Icon of self-extracting archive. This icon appears also in the main dialog.
Only icon from ICO file or from Win32 executable could be loaded. Loading
icons from 16-bit (e.g. Win 3.11 and older) executables is not supported.</dd>

<dt><i>Start extraction automatically</i></dt>
<dd>Starts extraction immediately after the self-extracting archive is opened.
It does not display any user prompt.</dd>

<dt><i>Hide main self-extractor's dialog</i></dt>
<dd>Doesn't show main self-extractor's dialog and unpacks silently at the background.
But error messages or overwrite prompts are displayed. The option make sense only
if 'Start extraction automatically' is turned on.</dd>

<dt><i>Automatically create target directory</i></dt>
<dd>It creates target directory (if it's not existing) without any user prompt.
</dd>

<dt><i>Show operation summary dialog</i></dt>
<dd>Shows message box informing whether the extraction was finished successfully and
how much files were extracted in case of success.</dd>

<dt><i>Overwrite files automatically</i></dt>
<dd>Overwrites existing files in the <i>Extract to</i> directory without any
user prompt. Attention: it overwrites also readonly/hidden/system files.</dd>

<dt><i>Requires administrative privileges</i></dt>
<dd>Starts self-extracting archive with administrative privileges on Windows Vista
(this will trigger UAC - User Account Control), so it can unpack files
also to write-protected folders (e.g. Program Files).</dd>
