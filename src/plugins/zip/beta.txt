This file contains a report about bug fixes and new features
in ZIP. Plus sign means new feature addition, minus sign means
a bug fix. The latest news are at the top.


-sfx: do not show the license owner's address

-added association for PK4 (DOOM3)

-sfx: process the command line for the post-extraction command through
 ExpandEnvironmentStrings before handling it

-help updated and grammar fixed

-use the new SafeFileCreate parameter to preallocate files in order to reduce
 fragmentation

-set the target file size before extraction to avoid disk fragmentation;
 hopefully the final tweak :)

-fixed export/import of the "automatically create target directory" option in
 the SFX settings

Sal 2.5 beta 4-----------------------------------------------------------------

-fixed grammar in the sample configuration file for zip2sfx (com_cz.set)
-zip2sfx: added support for new SFX packages

-sfx: option to create the target directory automatically
-sfx: ability to set a custom web link in the bottom right corner of the dialog
-sfx: ability to set a custom company name in the bottom left corner of the dialog
-if the CRC does not match the central header we also compare it with the local
 header (unless the GPF_DATADESCR flag is set, which explicitly states that the
 contents of the local header are garbage)

-fixed grammar of Czech comments in the exported configuration file for zip2sfx

-fixed crash introduced by adding cache support for file reading during listing;
 happened when opening a file in a multi-volume archive failed and the user
 chose retry

-fixed the order of validations in some dialogs

-adjusted the message shown when loading a damaged ZIP comment

-added a check box to the Change Disk dialog during extraction allowing the use
 of WinZip naming conventions (Disk numbers in extension)
-improved detection of WinZip naming for multi-volume archives
-set the ES_AUTOHSCROLL flag on edit boxes that were missing it
-can extract archives that contain multiple consecutive backslashes in paths
-optimized preparation of data for extraction; complexity in the number of
 selected files reduced from n-squared to n log n

-can delete a directory with the read-only flag when moving it into the archive

-set the target file size before extraction to avoid disk fragmentation
-zip2sfx: refuse to create an SFX from a zip64 archive
-refuse to create an SFX from a zip64 archive
-fixed a bug in the deflate routinesâ€”the counter for compressed data size was
 limited to 512 MB (the length was counted in bits and stored in an unsigned
 long)
-support for reading zip64 (large archives)
-when running unpack-whole-archive on a zero-sized ZIP it no longer reports a
 meaningless error message
-fixed searching for the AES extra header

-support for extracting files encrypted with AES according to the WinZip
 specification (supported by WinZip 9.0)

-support for extracting files compressed with the Deflate64(tm) method (e.g.
 PKZip 6.0 and WinZip 9.0)

-corrected return value checks in some CreateFile calls
-stretched check boxes containing the text 'dialog box', which someone recently
 fixed (they originally contained only 'dialog')

-sfx: replaced some dynamically allocated buffers with static ones
-sfx: fixed a bug when extracting an encrypted ZIP created by other software
 than the ZIP plugin and containing 'stored' files

-sfx: ignore errors from MyGetDiskFreeSpace

-when overwriting a file in a subdirectory of a Unix archive memory was
 overwritten while processing the file name
-sfx: the command executed after unpacking the archive is no longer expanded to
 a full path automatically; ShellExecuteEx finds it in the current directory
 (target dir) itself

-progress now works correctly even when working with zero-length files
-if an error occurs while listing, show everything read so far, allow the user
 to extract it, and report the error at the same time
-if the packing operation produces an archive containing 65535 files, warn the
 user that the ZIP will not comply with the specification and some archivers may
 not be able to extract it
+support for working with archives that contain more than 65535 files (unpack
 and pack)
+support for WinZip-style multi-volume archive naming when packing
+support for WinZip-style multi-volume archive naming when unpacking

-fixed German translations in the SFX

-renamed "dialog" to "dialog box"
-fixed incorrect behaviour when overwriting files in a Unix archive; it behaved
 oddly when there were multiple files differing only in timestamp

-use CSalamanderGeneral::UpdateCrc32
-if a ZIP file name contained multiple slashes in the path, replace them with a
 single slash
+support for UNIX archives:
 -case-sensitive CSalamanderDirectory
 -extraction (full names and root path) is case-sensitive
 -packing: root path case-sensitive, names (without root path) case-insensitive
  (we are on Win32)
 -deletion case-sensitive

-sfx can now unpack a multi-volume archive whose name contains diacritics
+the value 'none' of the 'mbox_type' variable in the SFX configuration file has
 been renamed to 'simple'
+added an option to the SFX configuration file to create message boxes with long
 text (useful for license agreements); added the new 'agree_disagree' value for
 the 'mbox_buttons' variable and the 'long_message' value for the 'mbox_type'
 variable
+renamed the 'mbox_icon' variable to 'mbox_type' in the SFX configuration file;
 the original name still works, but using the new name is preferred
+in SFX text settings it is possible to choose the "agree disagree" buttons for
 a long message box
+in SFX text settings it is possible to choose a new message box type for long
 texts (useful for license agreements)
-bad link (backslash instead of slash) in the About dialog
-added a test to the 'NextVolume' dialog to check whether the specified file
 exists
-case-insensitive CSalamanderDirectory (directories are merged)
-extraction: file names (without path) case-sensitive (so F3 works), paths
 case-insensitive (all combined into the first one encountered)
-packing: root path case-insensitive, names (without root path) case-insensitive
 (we are on Win32)
-deletion: file names (without path) case-sensitive, path case-insensitive
-warning about a damaged ZIP archive appeared when packing into a newly created
 archive failed to finish successfully
+send notifications about path changes when exporting SFX configuration
