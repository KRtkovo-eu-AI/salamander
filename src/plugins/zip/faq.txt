Q: I tried to Pack same files with ZIP. It was not Working. I coud not select 
   a Packer my list was emty.

A: Something gone wrong with the plugin installation. To reinstal the plugin
   manually open the 'Plugins' diolog from 'Options' menu, if the ZIP plugin
   in present in the list, remove it. Then add 'zip.spl' file, it should be found 
   in the 'plugins\zip' subdirectory of your Servant Salamander directory.
   If you can't found 'zip.spl' download the latest version from our web site or
   reinstall Servant Salamander.


Q: When I doubleclick on a .zip	file I get my external zip processor invoked 
   instead of ZIP.

A: You haven't associated ZIP with ZIP plugin. The association could be
   set in Servant Salamander configuration ('Options'/'Configuration...'/
   'Panel Archivers'/'Extensions'). 
   Note: if the ZIP plugin isn't in the archivers list, reinstal the plugin
   manually. Open the 'Plugins' diolog from 'Options' menu, if the ZIP plugin
   in present in the list, remove it. Then add 'zip.spl' file, it should be found 
   in the 'plugins\zip' subdirectory of your Servant Salamander directory.
   If you can't found 'zip.spl' download the latest version from our web site or
   reinstall Servant Salamander.


Q: Every time I open the self-extractor settings dialog I get error a message
   'Self-extractor file is corrupted.'

A: Download the correct SFX file from our web site and install it over the corrupted 
   one.
   Or if you don't need it just remove the currupted *.sfx file from 
   'plugins\zip\sfx' subdirectory of your Servant Salamander directory.
