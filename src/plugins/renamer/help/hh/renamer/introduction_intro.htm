<h1>Getting Started with Renamer Plugin</h1>

<p>With Renamer plugin you can rename many files and directories (optionally including
subdirectories) in a batch using specified rules. You can e.g.
search for substrings in names and replace them with something else; insert size, time, and
date stamps; insert counters with decimal or hexadecimal base; use regular expressions for
sophisticated substitutions and reordering; change case of names and extensions; rename also
filenames including full or relative path (move files to another directories); and use manual
mode for direct filenames renaming (like in text editor). All planned changes are visible in
real-time preview of resulting names. These changes are committed to a disk when you click on
the Rename button. Moreover, in case of need, you can revert all performed rename operations
using the Undo command.</p>
