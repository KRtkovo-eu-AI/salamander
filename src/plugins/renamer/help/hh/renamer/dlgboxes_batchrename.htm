<h1>Batch Rename</h1>

<p>Use this dialog to rename many files and directories in a batch using specified rules.</p>
<h4>Menu</h4>

The Batch Rename dialog contains menu with following commands:

<a id="rename"></a>

<dl>
<dt><i>Commands/Rename</i></dt>

<dd>Starts batch renaming. It changes filenames on disk according to rules
specified in this dialog. It can also move files to another directories if you
rename filenames including their full or relative paths.
</dd>

<dt><i>Commands/Validate</i></dt>

<dd>Tries if batch renaming will succeed. It reports syntax errors in new filenames,
duplicate filenames (more original filenames with the same resulting name), and some
other errors. Use this command to prevent only partially finished batch rename
operation.
</dd>

<dt><i>Commands/Undo</i></dt>

<dd>Reverts all performed rename operations in the last batch (the last use of the
Rename command).
</dd>

<dt><i>Commands/Exit</i></dt>

<dd>Closes this Batch Rename dialog.
</dd>

<dt><i>Edit/Store List to Clipboard</i></dt>

<dd>Works only in the manual mode of the batch rename, see the Manual mode checkbox.
Copies the list of new names to clipboard, so you can e.g. paste it to your favorite
text editor to edit them.
</dd>

<dt><i>Edit/Load List from Clipboard</i></dt>

<dd>Works only in the manual mode of the batch rename, see the Manual mode checkbox.
Replaces the list of new names by a text from the clipboard, so you can use it e.g.
to copy the changed list of new names from your favorite text editor back
to this dialog.
</dd>

<dt><i>Edit/Open List in External Editor...</i></dt>

<dd>Works only in the manual mode of the batch rename, see the Manual mode checkbox.
It saves the list of new names to a temporary file, opens this file in your favorite
text editor, and waits until you finish editing and save changes. Then it loads back the
list of new names from this temporary file. You can specify your favorite text editor
in the <a href="dlgboxes_advoptions.htm">Advanced Options dialog</a>.
</dd>

<dt><i>Edit/Filter List Through Shell Command...</i></dt>

<dd>Works only in the manual mode of the batch rename, see the Manual mode checkbox.
It executes specified shell command (or any command line application) and sends it
the list of new names to the standard input. The standard output of this shell command
is used as the new list of new names.
</dd>

<dt><i>View/Sort by Original Name</i></dt>

<dd>Changes sorting of items in the Preview listview to sorting by the Original Name column.
</dd>

<dt><i>View/Sort by Size</i></dt>

<dd>Choose this option if you want to work only with filenames without paths.
</dd>

<dt><i>Options/Rename Relative Path</i></dt>

operation. Use this command to easily repeat the same batch rename operation.
