<h1>Transfer Modes</h1>

<p>
As different platforms (operating systems) uses different format of text files, many transfer protocols
support special mode for transferring text files (called text or <acronym title="American Standard Code
for Information Interchange">ASCII</acronym> mode). In the mode the file is not only transferred, but
also converted to format used by the target platform. The mode must not be used for binary files (including
document files from modern text processors, like Microsoft Word), as they must be transferred without
modification.
</p>

<a name="available_modes"></a>
<h4>Available Modes</h4>

<p>
WinSCP offers you the chance to select between <em>Text</em> and <em>Binary</em> transfer modes. It is set
as one of the <a href="transfer_settings.htm">transfer settings</a>.
</p>

<p>
WinSCP also has a special <em>Automatic</em> mode (default). With this mode WinSCP decides automatically
about transfer mode for a particular file based on its filename (usually the file extension). The so-called
text file mask can be configured in dialogs mentioned above. By default it includes
HTML, TXT, PHP, XML, INI, C, CPP and other file types. You can modify the mask as you need. Files not matching the mask are
transferred using <em>Binary</em> mode.
</p>

<a name="server-side_text_file_format"></a>
<h4>Server-side Text File Format</h4>

<p>
There are two options how to support text mode transfers. The first option is that the client (WinSCP) knows
directly the text file format used by the server and converts the file to the format before transfer. The
second option is that there is some in advance agreed canonical format to which the client converts the file
before transfer and from which the server converts it (if necessary) after transfer to its own format.
</p>

<p>
The second option is more universal, but it is supported only by <a href="protocols.htm#sftp">SFTP-4</a>
and newer.
</p>

<p>
The first option is used by WinSCP for <a href="protocols.htm#scp">SCP</a> SFTP-3 and older protocols.
It this case the client (WinSCP) must directly know and support the server-side format. Generally there
are plenty of text file formats, almost every platform has it own format. WinSCP supports two of the most
used formats, Unix and Windows. You can select between them on
<em><a href="ui_login_environment.htm#end-of-line_characters">Environment tab</a></em> of Login Dialog. As most
<acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym> servers are run on Unix system, generally you may leave the
default Unix format.
</p>

<a name="transferring_large_text_files_with_scp_protocol"></a>
<h4>Transferring Large Text Files with SCP Protocol</h4>

<p>
Note that due to <a href="protocols.htm">SCP protocol</a> requirements WinSCP needs to know
the size of converted text files before the transfer actually starts. For that reason with
<acronym title="Secure Copy Protocol">SCP</acronym> protocol, the whole file is converted in
memory before the transfer.
</p>

<p>
If the file is too large (not common for text files), you can run out of memory during
conversion. So to transfer large text file, either force binary mode (if possible) or switch
to <a href="protocols.htm">SFTP protocol</a>.
</p>

<h4>Changing Transfer Mode</h4>

<p>
The transfer mode is set as part of <a href="transfer_settings.htm">transfer settings</a>.
