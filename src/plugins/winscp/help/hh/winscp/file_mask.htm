<h1>Masks</h1>

<p>
To use the following features of WinSCP you need to specify a mask (wildcard) to select files (or other things):
</p>

<ul>
<li>Text file mask for <a href="transfer_mode.htm">text mode transfers</a>.</li>
<li><a href="ui_transfer.htm#other_options">Ignore mask</a> for transfers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Filename Mask</h4>
<p>
When specifying the mask you can use following patterns:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Pattern </th>
    <th>Meaning </th>
    <th>Example </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>*</code> </td>
    <td>Matches any number (including zero) of arbitrary characters. </td>
    <td><code>*.doc; about*.html</code> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>?</code> </td>
    <td>Matches exactly one arbitrary character. </td>
    <td><code>photo????.jpg</code> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>[abc]</code> </td>
    <td>Matches one character from the set. </td>
    <td><code>index_[abc].html</code> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>[a-z]</code> </td>
    <td>Matches one character from the range. </td>
    <td><code>index_[a-z].html</code> </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
All other characters are treated literally.
</p>

<p>
To escape character with special meaning (<code>*?[</code>) enclose 
it into set pattern, e.g. <code>filewithstar[*]</code>.
</p>

<h4>Directory Mask</h4>

<p>
Particularly when specifying an <a href="ui_transfer.htm#other_options">include mask</a>
for transfers, bear in mind that it is 
applied to directories as well, so that <code>*.bak</code> will only 
match backup files located in the current directory (unless 
you happen to have a subdirectory whose own name ends in ".bak",
in which case it will be applied to all backup files 
in there too).
</p>

<p>
A mask ending with slash matches only directories. The mask 
<code>*/</code> matches any directory.
</p>

<p>
For example to transfer only HTML files located in any 
directory, use the include mask <code>*/; *.html</code>
(see below for combining masks).
</p>

<p>
To make operation non-recursive use exclude mask <code>*/</code>.
</p>

<h4>Path Mask</h4>

<p>
When the mask selects files and it makes sense to select them based on directory, you can extend the mask
with a path mask. You should separate the path mask from the filename mask by a slash. For example
mask <code>/home/martinp/*.txt</code> matches all text files within the directory, but not in subdirectories.
To match all text files within subtree, use mask <code>/home/martinp/*.txt; /home/martinp/*/*.txt</code>
(Simpler, but less precise, form would be <code>/home/martinp*/*.txt</code>).
</p>

<p>
For a relative path mask it makes no difference whether you use back (<code>\</code>) or forward slashes (<code>/</code>); the
mask will always work for both local and remote paths. For example, the mask
<code>*/public_html/*.bak</code> will match backup files both in <code>D:\Documents\public_html</code>
and <code>/home/martinp/public_html</code>. If you want to match directories only, add a slash at the end
of the mask.
</p>

<p>
You can also specify full path to specific file or directory, both local and remote.
For example if you want to match only specific <code>.csv</code> directory, not all,
use <code>/home/martinp/data/.csv/</code> instead of <code>.csv/</code>.
</p>

<p>
Particularly when specifying an <a href="ui_transfer.htm#other_options">include mask</a> for transfers, bear
in mind that it is applied to directories as well, so that <code>*.bak</code> will only match backup files
located in the current directory (unless you happen to have a subdirectory whose own name ends in &quot;.bak&quot;, in
which case it will be applied to all backup files in there too).
</p>

<p>
The mask <code>*/</code> matches any directory. For example to transfer only
<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> files located in any directory, use the include
mask <code>*/; *.html</code>.
</p>

<h4>Exceptions</h4>

<p>
For convenience, a masks <code>*.*</code> and <code>*.</code> are exceptions matching any file and any file
without an extension, respectively, even if its name does not include any dot.
</p>

<h4>Combining masks and exclude mask</h4>

<p>
You can combine several masks using semicolon (<code>;</code>) or comma (<code>,</code>).
</p>

<p>
You can add exclude mask by separating it by pipe (<code>|</code>) 
from the include mask. To use exclude mask only, start with 
pipe straight away.
