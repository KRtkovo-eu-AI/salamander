<h1>Directories Tab (Login Dialog)</h1>

<p>
<em>Directories tab</em> allows user to configure initial session directory and the way how directory
content is read.
</p>

<h4>Directories</h4>

<p>
When the <em>Remember last used directory</em> checkbox is ticked, the initial directory for the session
(see <em>Remote directory</em>) will always be updated with the last opened
directory from the last session. It makes sense to use the option only if you <a href="ui_login_save.htm">save
your session preferences</a> to stored session, because it is the stored session that gets updated on each
session close.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Remote directory</em> box defines the initial remote directory opened in panel. When <em>Remember
last used directory</em> is ticked the path is updated whenever the session is closed. When the initial
directory is not specified the user home directory is usually opened on startup. Note that this may not be
true particularly for <acronym title="SSH File Transfer Protocol">SFTP</acronym> servers.
</p>

<a name="directory_reading_options"></a>
<h4>Directory Reading Options</h4>

<p>
The section is hidden, unless advanced options are enabled.
</p>

<p>
<em>Cache visited remote directories</em>, <em>Cache directory changes</em> and <em>Permanent cache</em>
checkboxes control <a href="directory_cache.htm">directory cache</a>.
</p>

<p>
When WinSCP reads directory content, it by default also resolves any symbolic links (symlinks) it finds. Particularly
to learn if they point to file or directory. If a directory contains too many symbolic links, it can slow down
opening the directory. You may disable the feature by unticking <em>Resolve symbolic links</em> to speed it
up. You may also use the option when WinSCP hangs when resolving cyclic links. While WinSCP detects most cyclic
links, it can still hang when it encounters more complex symbolic link &quot;systems&quot;.
When the resolving is disabled, double-clicking on any remote file will be
interpreted as an attempt to open the directory with the same name.
This allows opening links pointing to directories even when WinSCP
does not know they are links.
