<h1>Operation Mask</h1>

<p>
When using some features of WinSCP you may specify operation mask. For example in:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="ui_copy.htm#target_directory">Target directory/file box</a> in transfer options dialog when
    <a href="task_upload.htm">uploading</a> or
    <a href="task_download.htm">downloading</a> files.</li>
<li>Target directory/file box when <a href="task_move_duplicate.htm">moving or duplicating</a> remote files
    to different remote directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Operation mask can be used to change name of the file being transferred/moved.
</p>

<p>
The simplest operation mask is new filename. For example when you are uploading file and you type
<code>/home/martinp/configuration.txt</code> in <a href="ui_copy.htm#target_directory">target directory/file box</a>,
the file will be stored in remote directory <code>/home/martinp</code> under the name
<code>configuration.txt</code>, whatever the original filename is.
</p>

<p>
Such simple operation mask is useful only when transferring/moving one file only. When you are
working with set of files you need to use some of the special characters to let each file be
stored under different, yet changed, name. In addition the mask can have two parts, separated by
dot (<code>.</code>), which allows you to change base filename and the filename extension
separately. These special characters are:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Character </th>
    <th>Meaning </th>
    <th>Example </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>*</code> </td>
    <td>Keep all remaining characters of part of source filename as is. </td>
    <td><code>a*.doc</code> to change the first letter of all files to <code>a</code> and to
		    change extensions of all files to <code>doc</code>. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>?</code> </td>
    <td>Keep the next character of part of source filename as is. </td>
    <td><code>*.??~</code> to replace third letter of file extension with <code>~</code>. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>\</code> </td>
    <td>Treat the next character literally (only for changing names of remote files, i.e. for upload). </td>
    <td><code>\*</code> to store file under the name <code>*</code>. </td>
  </tr>
</table><br/>

<p>
All other characters are treated literally, i.e. they will become part of the target filename.
</p>

<p>
WinSCP by default offers you operation mask <code>*.*</code> that leaves filename as is. Note that
you will achieve the same effect with simple <code>*</code> (but not with <code>*.</code> that would
trim file extension).
