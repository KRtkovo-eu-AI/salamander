<h1>Progress Window</h1>

<p>

Depending on kind of operation it will show various information about its progress.
</p>

<a name="general_information"></a>
<h4>General Information</h4>

<p>
<em>File</em> box shows name of a file that WinSCP is currently working with.
</p>

<p>
Progress indicator shows approximately what part of the operation is already complete. The indicator
is more accurate when <a href="ui_transfer.htm#common_options">calculation of total transfer size</a>
is enabled.
</p>

<a name="transfer_information"></a>
<h4>Transfer Information</h4>

<p>
During transfer operation (<a href="task_upload.htm">upload</a> or
<a href="task_download.htm">download</a>) additional information is shown.
</p>

<p>
<em>Target</em> box shows target directory of the transfer (local for downloads, remote for uploads).
</p>

<p>
<em>Time left</em> shows time estimated till operation end. If
<a href="ui_transfer.htm#common_options">calculation of total transfer size</a> is disabled,
<em>Start time</em> will be shown instead. <em>Time elapsed</em> shows time elapsed since operation started.
</p>

<p>
<em>Bytes transferred</em> shows total number of bytes transferred in current operation.
</p>

<p>
<em>CPS</em> shows transfer speed in characters (bytes) per second.

<h4>Controlling the Operation</h4>

<p>
Use <em>Cancel</em> button to cancel the operation. Note that with
<a href="protocols.htm#scp_secure_copy_protocol">SCP protocol</a> the transfer of file cannot be
interrupted without closing whole session.
</p>

<p>
Use <em>Once finished</em> to choose <a href="once_done.htm">action to do</a>
once the operation is completed. Note that the chosen action may cancel any
<a href="transfer_queue.htm">background transfers</a> associated with
current session.
</p>

<p>
Use <em>Speed</em> to limit transfer speed.
Available only for transfer operation.
The limit is in <acronym title="Kibibyte (1,024 bytes)">KiB</acronym>/s.
To remove speed limit, set it to "Unlimited".
Initial transfer speed can be set as part of
<a href="ui_transfer.htm">transfer settings</a>.
