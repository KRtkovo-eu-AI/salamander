<h1>SCP/Shell Tab (Login Dialog)</h1>

<p>
<em><acronym title="Secure Copy Protocol">SCP</acronym>/Shell tab</em> allows user to configure
shell specific options. Mostly it helps WinSCP to modify remote
environment to match its <a href="requirements.htm#scp_requirements">requirements</a>.
The options are mainly used when working with
<a href="protocols.htm#scp">SCP protocol</a>.
Even if you are using <a href="protocols.htm#sftp">SFTP protocol</a>, some of the options are made available for you,
in case are using some feature that require <a href="shell_session.htm">separate shell session</a>.
</p>

<p>
You need to check <em>Advanced options</em> to reveal the tab.
</p>

<a name="shell"></a>
<h4>Shell</h4>

<p>
Use the <em>Shell</em> option to specify what shell WinSCP will use.
The <code>bash</code> shell is recommended for working with WinSCP. If your default shell does not
work with WinSCP, you can specify another shell. Typing the full path (e.g. <code>/bin/bash</code>
or <code>/usr/local/bin/bash</code>) is recommended.
You can also make use of the option to alter session startup.
For example to change the user after login (known as <code>su</code>)
<a href="#fn1">(see note 1)</a>.
The command to start shell is interpreted by the <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym> server,
so the syntax can change with the server <a href="#fn2">(see note 2)</a>.
</p>

<p>
WinSCP needs to know what environment variable contains exit code of the last command. By default it
tries to autodetect that. However the autodetection can fail and also slows down login. You may specify
the variable directly instead in <em>Return code variable</em> box.
</p>

<a name="directory_listing"></a>
<h4>Directory listing</h4>

<p>
Use the <em>Listing command</em> to change shell command,
WinSCP uses to list directory contents.
Particularly if your shell does not print group name in directory listing
by default, use <code>ls -gla</code> to enforce it.
</p>

<p>
When the <em>Ignore LS warnings</em> checkbox is ticked, WinSCP will ignore any error messages printed by
the <code>ls</code> command as long as it produces some regular output too. It also makes WinSCP ignore exit
code <code>1</code> of the command. The option was added primarily to override <code>pagefile.sys</code>
access-error produced by <a href="http://sshwindows.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">OpenSSH for Windows</a>
whenever root directory was opened. However it may be useful even in other situations.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Try to get full timestamp</em> makes WinSCP attempt to use <code>--full-time</code> option for
<code>ls</code> command. It is particularly useful when you want to use some
<a href="task_synchronize.htm">synchronization</a> command, for what you need precise timestamps. When
it is ticked, WinSCP will add the option to the first <code>ls</code> command it issues. When the
(first) command fails for whatever reason, WinSCP will stop using the option for the whole session.
However in some cases WinSCP may fail to detect that the command failed. Then you need to disable the
feature manually.
</p>

<a name="other_options"></a>
<h4>Other Options</h4>

<p>
When <em>Lookup user groups</em> is ticked, WinSCP will use <code>groups</code> command on start-up to list
groups the user belongs too. It will then offer the list on <a href="ui_properties.htm">Properties dialog</a>
to allow user select the group instead of typing it.
</p>

<p>
During WinSCP start up, you may receive an error indicating a problem with the <code>groups</code>
command. Untick the <em>Lookup user groups</em> box. More than likely your Linux environment doesn't have
the <code>groups</code> command available.
</p>

<p>
On start-up WinSCP will by default clear all aliases on commands it uses. This is done to avoid unexpected
behaviour (e.g. alias <code>rm</code> to <code>rm -i</code>). If there are no aliases influencing command
behaviour, this feature can be disabled by unticking <em>Clear aliases</em>.
</p>

<p>
WinSCP also clears set of environment variables know to influence the format of directory listing. These
are: <code>LANG</code>, <code>LANGUAGE</code>, <code>LC_CTYPE</code>, <code>LC_COLLATE</code>,
<code>LC_MONETARY</code>, <code>LC_NUMERIC</code>, <code>LC_TIME</code>, <code>LC_MESSAGES</code> and
<code>LC_ALL</code>. If no such variable is set, untick <em>Clear national variables</em>. This setting
speeds up the login process.
</p>

<p>
WinSCP uses <code>scp</code> command to perform the transfer. On some <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym>
servers, particularly ssh.com, the <code>scp</code> may be a link to <code>scp2</code> command. The
<code>scp2</code> is in fact <acronym title="SSH File Transfer Protocol">SFTP</acronym> server, that WinSCP
cannot talk to in <acronym title="Secure Copy Protocol">SCP</acronym> mode. Check <em>Use scp2 with scp1
compat.</em> to make WinSCP try to force the <code>scp</code> command to use really the
<acronym title="Secure Copy Protocol">SCP</acronym> protocol (using <code>-1</code> option). Note that
if the server supports <code>scp2</code>, it probably supports
<a href="protocols.htm#sftp">SFTP protocol</a> too.
</p>
