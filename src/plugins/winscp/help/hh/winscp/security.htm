<h1>A word of warning</h1>

<p>
Like with any security or cryptographic product, there are a number
of concerns that should be addressed. To use WinSCP
securely, you should understand how the program works and the concepts involved.
Improper usage is often insecure usage, so please be sure to read the manual completely.
</p>

<a name="host_security"></a>
<h4>Host Security</h4>

<p>
The security of the computer running WinSCP is a serious
concern. Trojan Horse and Backdoor programs can steal authentication credentials
such as passwords and <a href="public_key.htm#private">private keys</a>
that have been stored or entered on the computer. Public computers
often have session monitoring software - including key loggers -
or other malicious software.
</p>

<p>
WinSCP can support <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym> &quot;keyboard-interactive&quot; authentication
methods if offered by the server. With keyboard-interactive
authentication, the server can prompt for special credentials such
as a S/Key one-time password or <acronym title="Rivest, Shamir &amp; Adelman">RSA</acronym> SecurID generated value. These
&quot;disposable&quot; credentials are preferable if you must use a public
computer. Contact your system administrator to find out if any form
of one-time authentication is offered.
</p>

<a name="stored_credentials"></a>
<h4>Stored Credentials</h4>

<p>
WinSCP supports storing passwords with saved sessions. This is
provided as a convenience, and is not recommended,
unless protected by
<a href="ms-its:salamand.chm::/hh/salamand/othertask_pwdmanager.htm">master password</a>.
If you need to be
able to log in without reentering your credentials, the recommended
method with <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym> is to use public key authentication and protect your private
key with a pass phrase. The <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym> Key Agent provided by PuTTY, Pageant,
can store the decrypted key in memory, allowing you to enter your
credentials once and continue using them until you close down the
agent or log off of Windows entirely.
</p>

<p>
Saved passwords, unless protected by
<a href="ms-its:salamand.chm::/hh/salamand/othertask_pwdmanager.htm">master password</a>,
are stored in a manner that they can easily be
recovered. It is not possible to securely encrypt passwords in a way
that still allows for automatic use. Do not use the save password
feature if you are not absolutely sure of the physical and
electronic security of the system on which you are storing
passwords.
</p>

<p>
Password storing can be <a href="administration.htm">restricted by system administrator</a>.
