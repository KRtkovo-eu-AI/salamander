<h1>Directory Synchronization</h1>

<p>
WinSCP can synchronize content of local directory with remote one or vice versa or even mutually. Find
the function in WinSCP plugin menu. <a href="ui_synchronize.htm">Synchronize dialog</a>
will appear, where you can select synchronization mode and configure options.
</p>

<p>
Once you confirm your options, synchronization will start. Whenever WinSCP finds some change,
it can optionally ask you for confirmation (option <em>Preview changes</em>).
</p>

<p>
Files and directories <a href="ui_transfer.htm#other_options">excluded from transfer</a> are excluded
from synchronization too.
</p>

<p>
Before using the function make sure that WinSCP knows correct <a href="timestamp.htm">timestamps</a> of remote files,
to avoid losing data.
</p>

<h4>Synchronization Direction</h4>

<p>
There are three possible directions (targets) of synchronization.
</p>

<p>
With <em>Local</em> direction, changes from remote directory (source) are applied to local directory (target).
Only the local directory is modified.
</p>

<p>
<em>Remote</em> mode is the same as <em>Local</em>, just in an opposite direction: changes from the local directory (source)
are applied to the remote directory (target). Only the remote directory is modified.
</p>

<p>
In <em>Both</em> mode, both local and remote directories can be modified (both can act as both source and target).?
</p>

<a name="synchronization_mode"></a>
<h4>Synchronization Mode</h4>

<p>
There are three modes of synchronization.
</p>

<p>
With <em>Synchronize files</em> mode, the newer files in source directory are transferred to the opposite directory.
Files in source directory not present in target directory can optionally be transferred as well
(disable this using the option <em>Existing files only</em>).
Files in target directory not present in source directory are optionally deleted
(enable option <em>Delete files</em>).
In <em>Both</em> mode (see above), file not present in an opposite directory is considered new,
hence it is transferred (if allowed), but never deleted.
In other words, in <em>Both</em> mode, no file is ever deleted.
</p>

<p>
With <em>Mirror files</em> mode, the different (both newer and older) files in source directory are
transferred to the opposite directory. Otherwise the mode is the same as <em>Synchronize files</em>.
</p>

<p>
With <em>Synchronize timestamps</em> mode, the timestamps of target files are updated to match timestamps of source files.
It will not do any transfers, nor delete anything.
Simply, whenever it finds the same file in both directories it updates the timestamp of target file to match
the one of source file. In <em>Both</em> mode, it always updates the older timestamp.
The mode is available with <a href="protocols.htm#sftp">SFTP protocol</a> only.
