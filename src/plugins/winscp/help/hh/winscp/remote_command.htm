<h1>Remote Commands</h1>

<p>
WinSCP offers unique feature to execute command on remote server as with regular
terminal client. However as it cannot implement the
terminal fully, there are some limitations. Particularly, you cannot execute commands that
require terminal emulation or user input. See <a href="#limitations">below</a> for technical details.
</p>

<p>
Basically the feature is supported only for <a href="protocols.htm#scp">SCP protocol</a>. With
<a href="protocols.htm#sftp">SFTP</a> you can still use the feature by opening
<a href="shell_session.htm">separate shell session</a>, which in fact takes place automatically for you.
</p>

<h4>How to Enter the Remote Command</h4>

<p>
You can enter the command on the Open Salamander command line, while the WinSCP panel is the active one.
</p>

<h4>Technical Background of Terminal Limitations</h4>

<p>
Plugin does not support commands that require terminal 
emulation or user input.
</p>

<p>
Terminal emulation cannot be implemented at all as it is 
not possible to combine terminal emulation and file 
transfers in the same session. The reason is that with 
terminal emulation control characters have special meaning 
that is interpreted by the server. On the other hand the 
same characters (bytes) have special meaning in the file 
transfer protocols or may be simply present in the (binary) 
files being transferred.
</p>

<p>
If you happen to try execute command requiring terminal 
emulation, it will typically refuse to run with error 
message like "Error opening terminal", "No TTY available",
"stdin: is not a tty" or "Couldn't open /dev/tty for reading".
</p>

<p>
Plugin may possibly support user input. However most 
commands requiring user input does that via terminal 
emulation features. If your command needs plain input 
without terminal emulation you can use input redirection 
like:
</p>
  
<pre>
echo "some input" | command
</pre>
