<h1>Permissions</h1>

<p>
On several occasions you need or have chance to set remote file permissions (Unix-style). This includes:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Setting <a href="ui_transfer.htm">transfer options</a> when
<ul>
<li>setting <a href="ui_sal_pref_transfer.htm">default transfer options</a>.</li>
<li><a href="task_upload.htm">uploading</a> files.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Explicitly <a href="ui_properties.htm">changing file permissions</a>.</li>

</ul>

<a name="simple_permissions"></a>
<h4>Simple Permissions</h4>

<p>
The rows of checkboxes are used to set/unset specific permissions for the <em>Owner</em> (the owner of the file); the <em>Group</em> (members of file group); and
<em>Others</em> (all others). The label <em>R</em> stands for &quot;read permissions&quot;,
<em>W</em> for &quot;write&quot; and <em>X</em> for &quot;execute&quot;. For directories the &quot;execute permission&quot; means permission
to enter the directory (make it working directory).
</p>

<a name="special_permissions"></a>
<h4>Special Permissions</h4>

<p>
There are three special permissions. <em>Set <acronym title="User ID">UID</acronym></em> and
<em>Set <acronym title="Group ID">GID</acronym></em> are used with executable files. They grant the user,
who executes the file, permissions of file owner or group, respectively. <em>Sticky bit</em> for executable
files makes the kernel keep the memory image of the process after it has terminated, in order to avoid the
overhead of reloading it when it is re-invoked. <em>Sticky bit</em> for directories ensures that only the
owner of a file can remove or delete the file or directory.
</p>

<p>
Note that while non-Unix systems are usually able to map the 9 simple Unix-style permissions to their own
style, they probably won't be able to handle the 3 special permissions.
</p>

<p>
Also <a href="interoperability.htm">not all Unix SFTP servers</a>
are able to set the special permissions.

<a name="undefined_permissions"></a>
<h4>Undefined Permissions</h4>

<p>
When explicitly changing permissions of existing remote files, the checkboxes can be set to undefined
state <a href="#fn1">(see note 1)</a>.
It means that the particular permissions should be left to its current state. This is useful when
you want to change one particular permission for set of files/directories that have different permissions.
</p>

<p>
Note that this will not work fully for <a href="protocols.htm#scp_secure_copy_protocol">SCP protocol</a>
for files in subdirectories.
</p>

<a name="octal_format"></a>
<h4>Octal Format</h4>

<p>
The <em>Octal</em> box shows octal number representation of the permissions set by the above checkboxes.
You can enter the octal format directly instead of manually ticking the checkboxes. If you enter only
three numbers, the leading zero for unset special permissions is added automatically. When any of the
checkboxes are in undefined state the <em>Octal</em> box is empty.
</p>

<p>
Note that if permissions box pops up from an edit box, you can enter permissions in octal format directly
into the edit box, without having to pop it up.
</p>

<a name="other_options"></a>
<h4>Other Options</h4>

<p>
The <em>Add X to directories</em> checkbox makes WinSCP add &quot;execute&quot; permission to directories for
every permission group (owner/group/others) where there is a &quot;read&quot; permission set already.
</p>

<p>
On <a href="ui_properties.htm">Properties dialog</a> the option is available only when there is at
least one directory selected. Also it will not work for <a href="protocols.htm#scp_secure_copy_protocol">SCP protocol</a>
for subdirectories of selected directories.
</p>

<p>
The checkbox is disabled, if you check "execute" permissions explicitly
for all permission groups, as it makes it effectively useless.
