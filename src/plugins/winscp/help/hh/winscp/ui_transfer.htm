<h1>Transfer Settings</h1>

<p>
On several occasions you need or have chance to configure <a href="transfer_settings.htm">transfer settings</a>.
This includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting <a href="ui_sal_pref_transfer.htm">default transfer settings</a>.</li>
<li><a href="ui_copy.htm">Uploading/downloading</a> files.</li>
<li>Configuring custom settings for functions <em><a href="ui_synchronize.htm">Synchronize</a></em> and
<em><a href="ui_keepuptodate.htm">Keep remote directory up to date</a></em>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="transfer_mode"></a>
<h4>Transfer Mode</h4>
<p>
Use box <em>Transfer mode</em> to select preferred <a href="transfer_mode.htm">transfer mode</a>. If you
select <em>Automatic</em> mode, you should update the text <a href="file_mask.htm">file mask</a> in
<em>Transfer following files in text mode</em>.
</p>

<a name="filename_modification"></a>
<h4>Filename Modification</h4>

<p>
Use selector to choose a way how to convert filename case when transferring files. This is particularly useful
when transferring files between platform with case-sensitive file-system (like Unix) and platform with
case-insensitive file-system (like Windows or Mac). Special option <em>Lower case 8.3</em> is useful for
<a href="task_upload.htm">uploads</a> only. With it only files whose filename follows legacy
<acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym>-<acronym title="Disk Operating System">DOS</acronym> format (8-letter
name and 3-letter extension, all letters uppercase) are converted to lower case.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Replace &quot;\:*?&quot;</em> checkbox enables automatic modification of filenames to match Windows requirements.
</p>

<p>
On download, WinSCP:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Replaces characters that are not allowed in Windows filenames
   (<code>/\:*?\"&lt;&gt;|</code>) with <code>%XX</code>,
   where <code>XX</code> is hexadecimal representation of
   character <acronym title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</acronym>
   code;</li>
<li>Replaces trailing space with <code>%20</code>;</li>
<li>Replaces trailing dot with <code>%2E</code>;</li>
<li>Addends <code>%00</code> to the end of names with reserved 
    meaning on Windows (such as <code>NUL</code> or <code>PRN</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
On upload, WinSCP reverses the modifications to restore original filename.
</p>

<p>
As percent sign (<code>%</code>) has special meaning when the 
replacing is enabled, the sign itself has to be replaced, 
although it is allowed in Windows filenames. If you want to 
prevent that you need to turn the replacing off.
</p>

<h4>Attributes</h4>

<a name="upload_options"></a>
<h3>Upload Options</h3>

<p>
The <em>Set permissions</em> checkbox enables you to specify <a href="ui_permissions.htm">permissions</a> to be
set for the <a href="task_upload.htm">uploaded</a> files. When unchecked the newly uploaded files will have
default permissions <a href="#fn1">(see note 1)</a>,
which is platform-dependent, and the overwritten files usually preserve their previous
permissions, but this can also vary with the platform.
</p>

<p>
Note that while you may have rights to overwrite the remote file, you may not have rights to change its permissions.
You need then to uncheck the <em>Set permissions</em> to be able to upload the files without being prompted with an error
message.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Clear &quot;Archive&quot; attribute</em> checkbox makes plugin unset the &quot;archive&quot; attribute
of source files once the upload finishes.
</p>

<a name="download_options"></a>
<h3>Download Options</h3>

<p>
The <em>Preserve read-only</em> checkbox makes WinSCP to set &quot;read-only&quot; attribute to
<a href="task_download.htm">downloaded</a> files that do not have user-write permission set. The option
is not available if the server does not support UNIX-style permissions.
</p>

<a name="common_options"></a>
<h3>Common Options</h3>

<p>
The <em>Preserve timestamp</em> checkbox makes WinSCP preserve the last modification timestamp of the
transferred file. Note that there are several <a href="timestamp.htm">factors that can affect
timestamp recalculation</a> between local and remote filesystem.
</p>

<p>
Note that while you may have rights to overwrite the remote file, you may not have rights to change
its timestamp.
You need then to uncheck the <em>Preserve timestamp</em> to be able to <a href="task_upload.htm">upload</a>
the files without being prompted with an error message.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Calculate total size</em> checkbox make WinSCP calculate total size of all files to be
transferred before the actual transfer. It allows it then to estimate time necessary to complete
the transfer. Note that if you are going to transfer large number of files the calculation can
take significant time.
</p>

<p>
Use <em>Speed</em> to limit transfer speed.
The limit is in <acronym title="Kibibyte (1,024 bytes)">KiB</acronym>/s.
You can also change the speed on <a href="ui_progress.htm">progress windows</a>
while files are being transferred. To remove speed limit, set it to "Unlimited".
</p>

<a name="other_options"></a>
<h4>Other Options</h4>

<p>
In the <em>Exclude/Include mask</em> you can specify <a href="file_mask.htm">file mask</a> to
exclude certain files/directories (or file types) from the transfer. When <em>Exclude</em> option
is selected, the files/directories matching mask will be excluded from transfer. When <em>Include</em>
option is selected, only the files/directories matching mask will be transferred.
Leave mask empty to transfer all files/directories. The option also excludes files from
<a href="task_synchronize_full.htm">synchronization</a> and makes them be ignored by function
<em><a href="task_keep_up_to_date.htm">Keep remote directory up to date</a></em>.
</p>

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<p>
<a name="fn1"></a>
1) Note that <code>umask</code> is not interpreted by some (if not all)
<acronym title="SSH File Transfer Protocol">SFTP</acronym> servers.
