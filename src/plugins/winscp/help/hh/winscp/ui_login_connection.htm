<h1>Connection Tab (Login Dialog)</h1>

<p>
<em>Connection tab</em> allows you to configure general protocol-independent options for the connection.
</p>

<p>
You need to check <em>Advanced options</em> to reveal the tab.
</p>

<p>
More connection options are available on subtabs:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="ui_login_proxy.htm">Proxy</a> (connection through proxy server)</li>
<li><a href="ui_login_tunnel.htm">Tunnel</a> (connection through <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym> tunnel)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To configure connection thru proxy server, see <em><a href="ui_login_proxy.htm">Proxy tab</a></em>.
</p>

<a name="server_response_timeout"></a>
<h4>Server Response Timeout</h4>

<p>
By the <em>Server response timeout</em> you define how long should WinSCP wait for an answer from the
server before displaying window with option to <em>Abort</em> the connection. Note that the window does
not block the waiting, so when it is displayed and the response is finally received it disappears itself.
</p>

<a name="keepalives"></a>
<h4>Keepalives</h4>

<p>
Some servers (and also firewalls and routers on the way between the client and the server) disconnect
clients if they do not receive any data from it within a defined period. In the <em>Keepalives</em> box, you may
order WinSCP to send some dummy data in regular periods to avoid being disconnected. This period is defined
with <em>Seconds between keepalives</em>.
</p>

<p>
WinSCP implements two methods for keepalives. The basic option is to send <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym>-level
keepalives implemented by null <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym> packets
(<acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym> ignore messages). Some servers may be configured not to count
these packets as data and thus they will still disconnect clients sending them. Also if you use
<acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym>-1 and your server suffers
<a href="ui_login_bugs.htm#chokes_on_ssh-1_ignore_messages">"SSH-1 ignore message" bug</a>, this
method will not work.
</p>

<p>
As an alternative WinSCP can send dummy commands of the transfer protocol instead. For
<acronym title="SSH File Transfer Protocol">SFTP</acronym> it is implemented as canonization of path
<code>/</code>. For <acronym title="Secure Copy Protocol">SCP</acronym> it is implemented as
<code>echo</code> command. <a href="#fn2">(see note 2)</a>
</p>

<a name="internet_protocol_version"></a>
<h4>Internet Protocol Version</h4>

<p>
This option allows the user to select between the old and new Internet protocols and addressing
schemes (IPv4 and IPv6). The default setting is <em>Auto</em>, which means WinSCP will do something
sensible and try to guess which protocol you wanted. (If you specify a literal Internet address, it
will use whichever protocol that address implies. If you provide a hostname, it will see what kinds
of address exist for that hostname; it will use IPv6 if there is an IPv6 address available, and fall
back to IPv4 if not.)
</p>

<p>
If you need to force WinSCP to use a particular protocol, you can explicitly set this to <em>IPv4</em>
or <em>IPv6</em>. <a href="#fn1">(see note 1)</a>
</p>

2) With <acronym title="Secure Copy Protocol">SCP</acronym> this keepalive
method does not work while WinSCP waits for user prompt in the middle of file transfer.
