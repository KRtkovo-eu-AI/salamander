<h1>Directory Caching</h1>

<p>
WinSCP supports caching directory content. The caching can be configured per-session. To configure it
see <em><a href="ui_login_directories.htm">Directories tab</a></em> of Login dialog.
</p>

<p>
There are two caches. The first cache stores file listing of already visited directories. The cache
is enabled by default and can be disabled by unticking <em>Cache visited remote directories</em>
checkbox. The cache is temporary, i.e. not preserved between sessions.
</p>

<p>
The second cache stores information useful for changing directories, like existence of particular
directory and canonical paths (useful for <acronym title="SSH File Transfer Protocol">SFTP</acronym>
protocol only, as <acronym title="SSH File Transfer Protocol">SFTP</acronym> servers need not to
follow Unix-style path handling). The cache in enabled by default and can be disabled by unticking
the <em>Cache directory changes</em> checkbox. The cache can be permanent (enabled by default), i.e.
preserved between sessions. Note
that the cache is specific for a specific user/host. So you may need to disable it, if you are
running two servers on the same host with different path semantics. For
<acronym title="Secure Copy Protocol">SCP</acronym> protocol the cache has no benefit without
<em>Cache visited remote directories</em> being turned on as well.
</p>

<p>
When both caches are enabled, the already visited directory can be opened without any data exchange
with the server, i.e. immediately.
</p>

<p>
The directory cache is updated whenever you perform any operation on the directory, like file
transfer. If the directory is changed externally (not from WinSCP), you may use <em>Refresh</em>
command to reload directory content and update the cache. Note that running
<a href="remote_command.htm">remote command</a> purges the cache for the current directory only. If your
command modifies other directories too, you need to refresh them manually.
