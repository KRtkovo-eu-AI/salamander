<h1>Properties Dialog</h1>

<p>
In Properties Dialog you can view and <a href="task_properties.htm">change</a> properties of remote files and
directories. To display the dialog go to <em>Files &gt; Change Attributes</em>.
</p>

<p>
The dialog has two tabs. Each is described individually.
</p>

<a name="common"></a>
<h4>Common</h4>

<a name="file_information"></a>
<h5>File Information</h5>

<p>
In the upper part of the dialog you can see information about the selected file(s). The counter will
initially not include files and directories in subdirectories. Press <em>Calculate</em> button to
count even these.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Size</em> field will state &quot;Unknown&quot;, if the selection contains at least one directory. Press
<em>Calculate</em> button next to it to calculate the total size of all files in the selected directories
(symlinks are not followed).
</p>

<p>
When properties are shown for single symbolic link (symlink), link target will be shown in additional <em>Links to</em>
field. If you need to know link target frequently, you may want to display optional
<em><a href="ui_sal_pref_panel.htm">Link target</a></em> column in file panel.
</p>

<a name="ownership"></a>
<h5>Ownership</h5>

<p>
The <em>Group</em> and <em>Owner</em> boxes can be used to change ownership of the selected files. Initially
the boxes will show current ownership as long as all selected files has the same owner/group. Otherwise
the boxes will be empty. Leave them empty not to change the ownership, when you are changing other
properties (like permissions).
</p>

<p>
The boxes are disabled if current <a href="protocols.htm">protocol</a> does not allow changing ownership.
</p>

<p>
Some protocols may allow changing ownership by specifying
<acronym title="User ID">UID</acronym>/<acronym title="Group ID">GID</acronym>
numbers only. In that case you will see both username/groupname and
<acronym title="User ID">UID</acronym>/<acronym title="Group ID">GID</acronym>
in the boxes in form <em>name [number]</em>.
If you want to change ownership specify new number only.
<a href="#fn1">(see note 1)</a>
</p>

<a name="permissions"></a>
<h5>Permissions</h5>

<p>
The <a href="ui_permissions.htm">permissions</a> box can be used to change permissions of selected files.
</p>

<p>
The box is disabled if current <a href="protocols.htm">protocol</a>
does not allow changing permissions.
</p>

<p>
You can also set permissions for newly uploaded files directly in <a href="transfer_settings.htm">transfer settings</a>.
</p>

<a name="changing_properties_recursively"></a>
<h5>Changing Properties Recursively</h5>

<p>
If the selection contains at least one directory, there will be additional checkbox <em>Set group,
ownership and permissions recursively</em>. It will make WinSCP change the properties for all files
in selected directories.
</p>

<p>
With <a href="protocols.htm#sftp">SFTP protocol</a> this can take considerable
time as the change must be made for each file specially. With
<a href="protocols.htm#scp">SCP protocol</a> the change is made once for each selected
file or directory only, so it can be much quicker. However as consequence WinSCP will not be able to keep
some properties, especially permissions, of files in subdirectories unchanged, when you request it.
</p>

<a name="checksum"></a>
<h4>Checksum</h4>

<p>
The <em>Checksum</em> tab lets you calculate checksum/hash of selected file(s).
The feature is available with <a href="protocols.htm#sftp">SFTP protocol</a>
only, subject to support of respective
<acronym title="SSH File Transfer Protocol">SFTP</acronym> extension.
</p>

<p>
Use <em>Algorithm</em> selection to choose checksum/hash algorithm.
The dropdown list contains standard algorithms, however you can type
in name of any other algorithm supported by the server.
Use button <em>Calculate checksum</em> to request the calculation.
</p>

<p>
You can copy the calculated checksum(s) to clipboard using <em>Copy</em>
command of the display context menu.
</p>
