<h1>Authentication Tab (Login Dialog)</h1>

<p>
<em>Authentication tab</em> allows you to configure <a href="ssh.htm#authentication_in_ssh">authentication</a>
options of <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym> protocol.
</p>

<p>
You need to check <em>Advanced options</em> to reveal the tab.
</p>

<a name="bypassing_authentication"></a>
<h4>Bypassing Authentication</h4>

<p>
In <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym>-2,
it is possible to establish a connection without using
<acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym>'s mechanisms to identify
or authenticate oneself to the server.
Some servers may prefer to handle authentication in the data channel,
for instance, or may simply require no authentication whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
By default, WinSCP assumes the server requires authentication (most do),
and thus must provide a username. If you find you are getting
unwanted username prompts, you could try checking
<em>Bypass authentication entirely</em>.
</p>

<p>
This option only affects <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym>-2 connections.
<acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym>-1 connections always require
an authentication step. <a href="#fn1">(see note 1)</a>
</p>

<a name="attempt_authentication_using_pagent"></a>
<h4>Attempt Authentication Using Pagent</h4>

<p>
If this option is enabled, then WinSCP will look for Pageant
and attempt to authenticate with any suitable public keys Pageant
currently holds.
</p>

<p>
This behaviour is almost always desirable,
and is therefore enabled by default.
In rare cases you might need to turn it off in order to force
authentication by some non-public-key method such as passwords.
<a href="#fn1">(see note 1)</a>
</p>

<p>
Learn how to use the <a href="public_key.htm">Pageant</a>
(PuTTY's <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym> authentication agent)
application for public key authentication.
</p>

<a name="attempt_tis_or_cryptocard_authentication"></a>
<h4>Attempt TIS or CryptoCard authentication</h4>

<p>
TIS and CryptoCard authentication are (despite their names)
generic forms of simple challenge/response authentication available in
<acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym>-1 only. You might use them if you were using
S/Key one-time passwords, for example, or if you had a physical security token that generated responses
to authentication challenges. They can even be used to prompt 
for simple passwords.
</p>

<p>
With this switch enabled, WinSCP will attempt these forms of authentication if the server is willing to try
them. You will be <a href="ui_authenticate.htm#keyboard_interactive">presented with a challenge string</a>
(which may be different every time) and must supply the correct response in order to log in. If your
server supports this, you should talk to your system administrator about precisely what form these challenges
and responses take. <a href="#fn1">(see note 1)</a>
</p>

<a name="attempt_keyboard-interactive_authentication"></a>
<h4>Attempt keyboard-interactive authentication</h4>

<p>
The <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym>-2 equivalent of TIS authentication is called
&quot;keyboard-interactive&quot;. It is a flexible authentication method using an arbitrary sequence of
<a href="ui_authenticate.htm#keyboard_interactive">requests and responses</a>; so it is not only
useful for challenge/response mechanisms such as S/Key, but it can also be used for (for
example) asking the user for a new password when the old one has expired. <a href="#fn1">(see note 1)</a>
</p>

<p>
WinSCP leaves this option enabled by default, but supplies a switch to turn it off in case you should
have trouble with it. If your server uses keyboard-interactive authentication to ask for your password
only, and you wish to allow WinSCP to reply with password entered on
<em><a href="ui_login_session.htm">Session tab</a></em>, tick <em>Respond with password to
the first prompt</em>.
</p>

<a name="attempt_gssapi_sspi_authentication"></a>
<h4>Attempt GSSAPI/SSPI authentication</h4>

<p>
The switch tells WinSCP to attempt
<acronym title="Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface">GSSAPI</acronym>
or <acronym title="Security Support Provider Interface">SSPI</acronym>
authentication.
</p>

<p>
The <acronym title="Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface">GSSAPI</acronym> is a generic
<acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> for doing client-server authentication. The
motivation behind it is that every security system has its own
<acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym>, and the effort involved with adding different
security systems to applications is extremely difficult with the variance between security APIs. However, with a
common <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym>, application vendors could use the
generic <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> and it could work with any number of
security platforms (Kerberos, Entrust, ...).
</p>

<p>
The <acronym title="Security Support Provider Interface">SSPI</acronym>
is Microsoft specific (non-standard) implementation of
<acronym title="Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface">GSSAPI</acronym>.
</p>

<a name="allow_agent_forwarding"></a>
<h4>Allow agent forwarding</h4>

<p>
This option allows the <acronym title="Secure Shell">SSH</acronym> server to open forwarded connections back
to your local copy of Pageant. If you are not running Pageant, this option will do nothing. Learn more about
<a href="https://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/Chapter9.html#pageant-forward" target="_blank">agent forwarding</a>.
