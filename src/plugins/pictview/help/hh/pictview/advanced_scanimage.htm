<h1>Scanning Image</h1>

<p>You can scan documents directly to the viewer.</p>

<h3>32-bit (x86) version:</h3>

<p>If you have more scanners attached to your computer, use the
<a href="advanced_selscannersrc.htm">Select Scanner Source</a> command to choose
the appropriate scanner. 32-bit (x86) version uses TWAIN interface to scanners.
TWAIN x86 provides also WIA interface (Windows Image Acquisition), so you should
easily use any scanner.</p>

<h3>64-bit (x64) version:</h3>

<p>If you have more scanners attached to your computer, you will choose the
appropriate scanner whenever you start scanning. 64-bit (x64) version uses WIA
interface (Windows Image Acquisition). TWAIN x64 is not directly supported by
Windows and also supported only by some scanner manufacturers. If you cannot
connect to your scanner from 64-bit (x64) version try to connect it from 32-bit
(x86) version, it will probably work well with your scanner.</p>

<h3>To scan image:</h3>

</table></li>
<li>Scanned image will be displayed in PictView viewer window. You can use
