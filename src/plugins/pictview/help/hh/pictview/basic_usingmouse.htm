<h1>Using Mouse in Viewer</h1>

<p>You can choose one of four mouse modes for using the left mouse button in the viewer,
see the following table. Click the right mouse button to display context menu with
the most important commands. Double click the left mouse button to view the image
in the full screen or to exit the full screen view. The mouse wheel can be used for
scrolling the image up and down or opening next or previous image file from panel or
found files list in the Find window, see <a href="config_keybandmouse.htm">Keyboard &amp; Mouse tab
in Configuration</a> and <a href="basic_otherfiles.htm">Opening Previous or Next
File from Panel or Find Window</a>.</p>

<p>Left mouse button modes:</p>
<table>
 <tr><th>Mode</th><th>Shortcut key</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Hand</td><td>A</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Z</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Select</td><td>S</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Pick Color</td><td>P</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You can find all described mouse modes in viewer menu Tools.</p>

<h4>Hand</h4>

<p>This mode is useful if you do not see the whole image in the current view
(the image in the current zoom is larger than the viewer window). Press (and hold)
the left mouse button to "catch" the image and move mouse to scroll the image
in desired direction. To end scrolling just release the left mouse button.
</p>

<h4>Zoom</h4>

<p>Use this mode to change the zoom. Click the left mouse button to zoom in to the next
preset percentage and to center the view around the point you clicked. Press (and hold)
the Shift key and click the left mouse button to zoom out to the previous preset
percentage.</p>

<p>You can also use the marquee zoom. Select the area of the image you would like
to have filled the view. To start this action, press (and hold) the left
mouse button. It defines the first corner of the area (the opposite one is
dragged by the mouse pointer). When you press (and hold) the Space key, you will move
the whole area (not only the second corner). While dragging you can move the mouse
pointer near the edge of the view for scrolling the view.</p>

<h4>Select</h4>

<p>You can define a selected area of the image in this mode. The selected area is used
in several commands: <a href="advanced_crop.htm">Crop</a>,
<a href="advanced_copypaste.htm">Copy</a>,
<a href="advanced_print.htm">Print</a>, etc.</p>

<p>To define the selected area, you must press (and hold) the left mouse button. It defines
the first corner of the area (the opposite one is dragged by the mouse pointer). When
you press (and hold) the Space key, you will move the whole area (not only the second
corner). Press (and hold) the Shift key to constrain the area to a square. While dragging
you can move the mouse pointer near the edge of the view for scrolling the view.</p>

<p>See also: <a href="advanced_select.htm">select whole image or cancel
selection</a>.</p>

<h4>Pick Color</h4>

<p>Use this mode to see the coordinates (relative to the top-left image
corner) and RGB values of the image pixel under the mouse pointer.</p>
