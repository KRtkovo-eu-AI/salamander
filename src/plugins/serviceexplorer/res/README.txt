This directory should contain the original Service Explorer artwork:

  dir.ico  - icon used for the top-level virtual folder
  file.ico - icon used for individual service entries
  svc.bmp  - 16x16 bitmap strip for the plugin toolbar

The upstream 0.0.11 plugin distributed these files alongside the source
under the same names. They are intentionally not tracked in git because
of their binary format; copy them from your local 0.0.11 installation (or
any suitable replacements) before building the plugin.
