In the subdirectories salamand\translations, there are current translations of the latest version
published on the forum. This is a version that translators can work on, and it is available for
download at the Translators section on the forum.

ATTENTION: These are not the language versions for the current Salamander build!!!

All translation modifications are made exclusively on the last published version.

ATTENTION: After each translation change, release a new version of Translator with the current
translation versions to avoid confusion.

Maintain consistency in this directory and the directory of the last released version in salbin
in the subdirectory translator.

As soon as the current Salamander build is mature enough for a "translation-ready" release (any type,
even just EAP; it must run at least until the next released version for Translators), prepare a version
of Translator for the new version on the web for translators.

Further translation modifications will only be accepted for this new version.

If someone provides a modified old version and the translation of the new version has not yet been
changed, do a new import of the old version into the new one (no conflict will arise). Then naturally
release a new version of Translator with the current translation versions.
