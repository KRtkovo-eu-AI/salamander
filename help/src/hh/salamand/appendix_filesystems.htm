<h1>File Systems</h1>
<p>Windows supports four types of file systems on readable/writable disks: the
NTFS file system and three file allocation table (FAT) file systems: FAT12,
FAT16 and FAT32.</p>
<p>Windows also supports two types of file systems on CD-ROM and digital video
disk (DVD) media: Compact Disc File System (CDFS) and Universal Disk Format
(UDF).</p>
<p>The structures of the volumes formatted by each of these file systems, as well
as the way each file system organizes data on the disk, are significantly
different.</p>

<h5>FAT</h5>
<p>The FAT file system locates the file allocation table near the beginning of
the volume. FAT12 is the original implementation of FAT and is intended for very
small media (floppy disks). FAT16 was designed for small disks and simple directory
structures. FAT32 allowed users to create large volumes on large disks.</p>
<p>Two copies of the file allocation table are stored on the volume. In the event
that one copy of the file allocation table is corrupted, the other is used. The
file allocation table is stored in a byte offset specified in the FAT boot
sector's BIOS Parameter Block (BPB) so that the files needed to start the system
can be located.</p>

<h5>NTFS</h5>
<p>NTFS, the preferred native file system for Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7, is
a much more sophisticated, robust, and secure file system than any of the FAT
file systems. The NTFS data structures allow you to take advantage of new
features, such as:
</p>

<p><b>Recoverability</b> NTFS is a recoverable file system. A user seldom needs to
run a disk repair program on an NTFS volume. NTFS guarantees the consistency of
the volume by using standard transaction logging and recovery techniques. In the
event of a system failure, NTFS uses its log file and checkpoint information to
automatically restore the consistency of the file system.</p>

<p><b>Compression</b> NTFS supports compression on volumes, directories, and files.
Files that are compressed on an NTFS volume can be read and written by any
Windows-based application without first being decompressed by another program; 
decompression happens automatically during the file read. The file is compressed
again when it is closed or saved.</p>

<p><b>Encryption</b> The Encrypting File System (EFS) provides the core file
encryption technology used to store encrypted files on NTFS volumes. EFS
keeps files safe from intruders who might gain unauthorized physical access
to sensitive, stored data (for example, by stealing a portable computer or
external disk drive).</p>

<p><b>Security</b> On NTFS volumes, you can set permissions on shares, directories,
and files that specify which groups and users have access, and what level of 
access is permitted. NTFS file and directory permissions apply to users working on 
the local computer and to users accessing the file over the network from a shared
directory. You can also set share permissions that operate on network shares in
combination with file and directory permissions.</p>

<p><b>Disk quotas</b> You can use disk quotas to monitor and limit disk-space
use.</p>

<p><b>Reparse points</b> Reparse points are file system objects in NTFS that can
be applied to NTFS files or directories. A file or directory that contains a reparse
point acquires additional behavior not present in the underlying file system.
Reparse points are used by many of the new storage features in Windows 2000,
including volume mount points.</p>

<p><b>Volume mount points</b> Based on reparse points, volume mount points allow
administrators to graft access to the root of one local volume onto the directory
structure of another local volume.</p>

<p><b>Sparse files</b> Sparse files allow programs to create very large files
but consume disk space only as needed.</p>

<h5>Compact Disc File System (CDFS)</h5>
<p>Windows provides support for the ISO 9660-compliant compact disc file system
(CDFS), which supports long file names.</p>

<h5>Universal Disk Format (UDF)</h5>
<p>UDF is a file system defined by the Optical Storage Technology Association
(OSTA). UDF is compliant with the ISO 13346 standard and is the successor to
the CD-ROM file system (CDFS or ISO 9660).</p>
<p>UDF is targeted for removable disk media like DVD, CD, and Magneto-Optical
(MO) discs. Since UDF is based on open standards, it is intended to facilitate
data interchange between operating systems, and between consumer devices.</p>
