<h1>Opening Plugin File Systems</h1>

<p>You can easily open (connect to) plugin file system in
the <a href="navigating_chdrvmenu.htm">Change Drive Menu</a> and in the
<a href="windows_drivebar.htm">Drive Bar</a>. If you don't find
some file system in this menu/bar, find appropriate plugin in the
<a href="dlgboxes_plugn.htm">Plugins Manager dialog box</a> and set the
<i>Show FS item in Change Drive menu and Drive bar</i> check box. Also see
<a href="navigating_changedir.htm">Changing Directory</a> for other ways of opening
(changing directory to) plugin file system, mainly: Commands/Change Directory (Shift+F7)
and Edit/Paste (Ctrl+V).</p>

<p>When you open file system in panel, you can work with files and directories in it.
Just focus or select them and use <a href="basicwork_view.htm">View</a>,
<a href="basicwork_copy.htm">Copy</a> and
<a href="basicwork_move.htm">Move</a>
(it works in both directions - from/to other panel), <a href="basicwork_delete.htm">Delete</a>,
<a href="advwork_clipboard.htm">Copy to and Paste from clipboard</a>,
<a href="advwork_compare.htm">Compare Directories</a>, and other commands (search
menu for enabled commands). You can also use commands from context menu (use right mouse
click or Shift+F10).</p>

<p>The View command copies focused file from plugin file system to temporary directory.
This file is then opened in Viewer. Plugin can use cache for such files so if you try
to view the file second time, it's just displayed from temporary directory (to get the recent
version of file, use <a href="advwork_refresh.htm">Refresh</a>).</p>
