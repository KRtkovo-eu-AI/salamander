<h1>Configuring Open Salamander</h1>

<p>Configuration contains settings from Configuration dialog, main window
position, panel widths and current directories, and other options. To configure
Open Salamander, open Options menu and choose Configuration. Then select
required dialog box in the tree box. Change options you want to configure and
click the OK button.</p>

<h3>Saving the configuration</h3>
<p>To save configuration to the registry use command Options/Save Configuration.
By default, configuration is saved automatically when you are closing Open Salamander.
To change this behavior, open <a href="configuration_gener.htm">General
configuration page</a> and clear the <i>Save configuration on exit</i> check box.</p>

<h3>Exporting the configuration</h3>
<p>You can export Open Salamander's configuration to the file. Choose the
Options/Export Configuration command. If you save the configuration to a file
named config.reg and place this file to installation directory (near salamand.exe)
or in Vista or later rather in application data directory (typically
<i>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Open Salamander</i>),
that configuration will be imported from this file to the registry before loading
Open Salamander's configuration from the registry.</p>

<p>The configuration file is a simple text document; you can easily edit it with any
text editor. Administrators can change this file to suit their needs, then place it
in a network installation of Salamander, and Salamander is then ready to use in
network environment.</p>

<p>When exporting configuration, you can choose if you want to add clearing of registry
key with configuration (it takes place before importing keys and values). Use this
option if you want to use exported configuration file to fully replace current
configuration in registry. If you just want to change some values and leave the rest
of the current configuration in registry without change, clear this option. All keys
and values from the file overwrite current values in registry. If you delete some
values from the configuration file, you'll avoid overwriting the users' values
(users will have their own values - it's useful for window positions, and other
not-important-stuff).</p>

<h3>Importing the configuration</h3>
<p>You can import Open Salamander's configuration from the file. To get such file,
see previous section about exporting configuration. You can import configuration
from other computer or just return to previously exported configuration to undo
some unwanted changes.</p>

<p>Importing the configuration is quite simple. Just find the file with configuration
and open it (use Enter key or double-click on it). It should be opened in Registry Editor.
When it shows question if you want to add information from the file to registry,
you should close all running instances of Open Salamander. It will prevent overwriting
of newly imported configuration by automatic save of configuration on exit of Open Salamander.
When there is no running Open Salamander, press Yes in Registry Editor question
message box. Then it will import the configuration from the file to registry.
</p>

<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>Open Salamander's configuration is stored in the Windows Registry:
'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Open Salamander\X', where X is Open
Salamander's version.</p>
