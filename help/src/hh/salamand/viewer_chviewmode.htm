<h1>Changing View Mode</h1>

<p>The file content can be displayed as text (the Text view mode) or as
hexadecimal values (the Hex view mode) in the viewer. The viewer can autodetect
text files and display them as text while all other (binary) files are
displayed as hexadecimal values. You can prevent possible autodetection
problems by forcing Text or Hex view mode for specified files (see
<i>Force Text mode for files</i> and <i>Force Hex mode for files</i>
options in <a href="configuration_intvw.htm">Configuration/Internal Viewer</a>).</p>

<p>Use the following commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>Auto-Select: if checked, the viewer tries to autodetect if the file contains only
    text and should be displayed in the Text view mode (if not, it is displayed in the
    Hex view mode),</li>
<li>Hex (the Ctrl+H or F4 key) and Text (the Ctrl+T or F5 key): currently used
    view mode is checked, you can also change the view mode by selecting one
    of these items,</li>
<li>Set as Default: use this command to set the current view mode as default for all
    future viewing (it also turns off Auto-Select).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Remarks</h4>

<p>In the Text view mode, the file content is divided to text lines. You can choose
what types of line endings should be accepted, see <i>Line Ends</i> option in the
<a href="configuration_intvw.htm">Configuration/Internal Viewer</a>.</p>

<p>In the Hex view mode, the file content is divided to 16 bytes long lines. The first
displayed number is line offset (in hexadecimal number). The line content (up to 16 bytes)
follows, first as hexadecimal values and then also as text.</p>
