<h1>Understanding Files and Directories</h1>

<p>The Windows <a href="appendix_filesystems.htm">file systems</a> deals
with two kinds of data arrangement: files and directories.</p>

<p>Each file and directory must be given a unique name; within a directory you
cannot have two files, two directories, or a file and a directory with the same
name as each other. See <a href="appendix_filenames.htm">Naming a File or
Directory.</a></p>

<h3>Files</h3>

<p>Any data you record on a disk is stored in a file. Files contain information,
which may be from a word processor, from a paint program, from a database, or
the entire contents of a program.</p>

<p>Whether a file is visible or can be deleted and edited depends upon attributes
that are explained in the <a href="appendix_attributes.htm">File and Directory
Attributes</a>.</p>

<p>All files have a datestamp which shows what the system date and time were the
last time the file was written to. See <a href="appendix_times.htm">File 
and Directory Times</a>.</p>

<p>Each file can be either a binary or ASCII containing human-readable text.
See <a href="appendix_txtfiles.htm">Text Files Coding and End of Line
Characters</a>.</p>

<h3>Directories</h3>

<p>To store information in a logical manner, disks are generally organized into
directories, which are often referred to as folders. If you picture a disk as
a cabinet, with your programs, database files and pictures as the actual files,
than directories are the folders of the filing cabinet. Some of these
folders have further folders inside them, called subdirectories, which
themselves contain folders, and so on, indefinitely.</p>

<p>The directory or subdirectory containing any given subdirectory is known
as its parent directory.</p>

<p>The highest level of organization is the root directory.</p>

<p>The route you take along a directory tree to reach a file is called path.
As you proceed along the path, each branch of the tree is separated from the
next by a backslash (\) character. For example, the path of Pictures is
expressed as C:\My Downloads\Pictures. See <a href="appendix_paths.htm">Disk Path
Specifier</a>.</p>

<p>To refer to Summer.jpg, you use what is called pathname. This consists of a
file's path, followed by the name of the file, Summer.jpg's pathname would be
C:\My Downloads\Pictures\Summer.jpg.</p>
