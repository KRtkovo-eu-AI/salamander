<h1>Changing Directory</h1>

<p>The panel displays the list of files and directories from its current directory. Current
directories of left and right panels are independent, so you can view
two unrelated directories at the same time. The current directory is specified
by its full disk, archive, or plugin file system path which is displayed in
the <a href="windows_dirline.htm">Directory Line</a>.
</p>

<p>We will present ways of changing the current directory in the panel.
</p>
