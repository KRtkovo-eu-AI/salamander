<h1>Text Files Coding and End of Line Characters</h1>

<h5>Character Sets</h5>
<p>Text files use character sets. A character set contains punctuation marks,
numerals, uppercase and lowercase letters, and all other printable characters.
Each element of a character set is identified by a number.</p>

<p>Most character sets in use are supersets of the U.S. ASCII character set,
which defines characters for the 96 numeric values from 32 through 127. There
are major groups of character sets:</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Windows Character Set (single-byte coding scheme)</i></dt>
<dd>The Windows character set is the most commonly used character set in Windows.
It is essentially equivalent to the ANSI character set. The Windows character set
uses 8 bits to represent each character; therefore, the maximum number of
characters that can be expressed using 8 bits is 256 (2^8).  This is usually
sufficient for Western languages, including the diacritical marks used in Czech,
French, German, Spanish, and other languages.</dd>

<dt><i>Multibyte character set</i></dt>
<dd>Eastern languages employ thousands of separate characters, which cannot be
encoded by using a single-byte coding scheme. With the proliferation of computer
commerce, double-byte coding schemes were developed so that characters could be
represented in 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, or 32-bit sequences. This requires
complicated passing algorithms; even so, using different code sets could yield
entirely different results on two different computers. 
</dd>

<dt><i>Unicode Character Set</i></dt>
<dd>To address the problem of multiple coding schemes, the Unicode standard for
data representation was developed. A 16-bit character coding scheme, Unicode
can represent 65,536 (2^16) characters, which is enough to include all languages
in computer commerce today, as well as punctuation marks, mathematical symbols,
and room for future expansion. Unicode establishes a unique code for every
character to ensure that character translation is always accurate.</dd>

<dt><i>OEM Character Set</i></dt>
<dd>The OEM character set is typically used in full-screen MS-DOS sessions for
screen display. Characters 32 through 127 are usually the same in the OEM,
U.S. ASCII, and Windows character sets. The other characters in the OEM
character set (0 through 31 and 128 through 255) correspond to the characters
that can be displayed in a full-screen MS-DOS session. These characters are
generally different from the Windows characters.</dd>

<dt><i>Symbol Character Set</i></dt>
<dd>The Symbol character set contains special characters typically used to
represent mathematical and scientific formulas.</dd>

</dl>

<h5>End of Line Characters</h5>

<p>The MS-DOS (including Windows and OS/2), UNIX, and Macintosh operating
systems all use different characters to designate the end of a line within
a text file.</p>
