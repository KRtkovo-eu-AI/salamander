    We are sorry for inconvenience, unfortunately the underlying rendering engine cannot 
    be licensed anymore. If you know any suitable rendering engine that can be bundled 
    with Salamander, please contact us on support@altap.cz. Thank you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Open Salamander 3.04</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Open Salamander 3.03</h3>
<ul>
<li>When network path in panel has become inaccessible when Salamander's main
    window was inactive, it was not possible to cancel checking of inaccessible
    network path. You can use ESC key or click on close button in checking
    path window now.</li>
<li>FTP Client: OpenSSL updated to version 1.0.1h. Fixed SSL/TLS MITM
    vulnerability - CVE-2014-0224. Both libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll compiled
    with /DYNAMICBASE (ASLR - Address Space Layout Randomization) and /NXCOMPAT
    (DEP - Data Execution Prevention) options for better security.</li>
<li>UnISO: Fixed extraction of files over 4GB from HFS+ (ISO/DMG) archives.
    The extracted file content was clipped to modulo 4GB, leaving the rest
    filled with zeros.</li>
<li>UnISO: Xbox: Fixed extraction of CreationTime for the "Information on image"
    summary. Fixed scanning directories spanning over multiple sectors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Open Salamander 3.02</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shift+F3 (Open Active Folder command) uses short 8.3 name when available.
    It is possible to display and focus any name (even names requiring support of
    unicode) from panel in Window Explorer window.</li>
<li>Open Salamander and plugins are compiled with /DYNAMICBASE (ASLR - Address Space Layout Randomization) and 
    /NXCOMPAT (DEP - Data Execution Prevention) options for better security.</li>
<li>Fixed old UI glitch. Empty panel hint "There are no items in this panel." was sometimes painted several times 
    without erasing background.</li>
<li>Getting OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) folder location on Windows 8.1 works fine even with changed location of OneDrive folder.</li>
<li>If Google Drive folder does not exist on disk (sometimes when you are not logged in), Google Drive icon is 
    not shown in Change Drive menu and Drive toolbars.</li>
<li>Portable Executable Viewer: Text descriptions for DLL Characteristics flags such as Image can be relocated at load 
    time, Image is NX compatible, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Open Salamander 3.01</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hot Paths count extended from 10 to 30. Use Ctrl+Shift+= to add the current directory to
    Hot Paths. It works only if some Hot Path on position 11..30 is free.</li>
<li>Find window: new command Open All Selected (Shift+Enter). Opens all selected files and directories.</li>
<li>New option: Keep environment variables updated to system values.
 It is checked by default, Salamander reads system environment variables on start
 and when system environment variables are changed. Values of environment variables
 inherited from parent process are overwritten by values from system. Variables which
 do not exist in system remain untouched. Newly you can uncheck this option to use
 inherited environment variables in running Salamander and all processes started
 from it.</li>
<li>UnRAR.DLL is W2K compatible again (added missing TzSpecificLocalTimeToSystemTime).</li>
<li>Checksum plugin: fixed SHA-256 and SHA-512 for files with size from 0x20000000 bytes. Faster SHA-256 and SHA-512 algorithm.</li>
<li>OpenSSL 1.0.1g with fix pro TLS heartbeat read overrun (CVE-2014-0160).</li>
<li>Fixed Windows 8 problem with missing SALRTL9.DLL.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Open Salamander 3.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Compatible with Windows 8.1, 8, 7, Vista, XP, and 2000 (both 32-bit and 64-bit). Fixed
compatibility warning when starting Open Salamander on Windows 8.1.</li>
<li>New native x64 version of Open Salamander to bypass limitations of x86
applications (File System Redirector, Registry Redirector).
With x64 version you will see real directories on your disks instead of
redirected ones, x64 keys in Registry (x86 keys are under Wow6432Node),
and context menu items coming from x64 shell extensions.
All plugins were ported to x64 except of UnACE (there is no x64 version
of UnACE library) and third-party plugins: WinSCP and Eroiica Viewer.
Start x86 version for tasks you cannot finish with the x64 build.
Both x64 and x86 versions of Open Salamander 3.0 can be installed
at the same time and sharing the same configuration in the Registry.</li>
<li>Copy files on Windows 7 and later: we have added faster asynchronous algorithm
 for copying files to/from network. Its speed on our local GLAN network is 111 MB/s,
 conventional algorithm speed is 86 MB/s. It affects also moving of files in case
 you are not moving in scope of one volume (then it is just rename, not copy and
 delete).</li>
<li>Console version of WinRAR 5.0 supported.</li>
<li>Support for progress bars in Windows 7 and 8 taskbar buttons.</li>
<li>Hot paths are available in Open Salamander jump list (Windows 7+ feature).</li>
<li>Open Salamander 3.0 has most reliable copy routine on the market:
  <ul>
  <li>When copying is interrupted (e.g. network is temporarily disconnected or target disk is full),
  Salamander can retry copying and continue where copy operation was
  interrupted. It verifies end of unfinished target file against source file
  to detect potential write errors. It's especially useful for long transfers
  via VPN or other slow networks. Explorer and Total Commander (TC) always
  start from the beginning, retrying is not supported.</li>
  <li>Copying/moving links (junction points, symlinks, or volume mount points)
  to different disk: choose if you want to copy link target or skip it and
  just create empty directory. Explorer always skips links when moving and
  copies link target when copying, TC always copies link target.</li>
  <li>Copy can optionally remove ADS from copied files/directories.</li>
  <li>Copy is also optimized for slower VPN. It uses smaller blocks, so progress
  is smooth and you can cancel operation instantly. Explorer and TC uses
  always large blocks, so progress is changing slowly and cancel is unresponsible.</li>
  <li>Copy files or directories with ADS to disk not supporting ADS (e.g. FAT32 flash
  disk). Salamander asks if you want to continue and shows list of streams which
  will be lost. Explorer asks if you want to copy without properties. TC copies
  quietly without streams (it loses data without any warning).</li>
  <li>Note: Open Salamander, Windows Explorer, and Total Commander were tested with default settings.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Cloud Storage Services support:
  <ul>
  <li>Change Drive Menu and Drive Bar newly contain items for most popular
  Cloud Storage Services. Currently we have supported Google Drive,
  Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive.</li>
  <li>Google Drive icon overlay handler crashed when called from two threads
  simultaneously (for left and right panel), so we have added synchronization.
  We use this handler only for files/folders located in Google Drive folder
  (it is relatively slow).</li>
  <li>Fixed getting of location of Microsoft OneDrive local folder on Windows 8.1.
  Better displaying of files which are available online-only (they were hidden
  together with hidden and system files).</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Language translations:
  <ul>
  <li>New language versions: Dutch, French, Russian, Simplified Chinese, and Slovak. 
  Note: Dutch and French versions are not completely translated.</li>
  <li>Existing language versions: English, Czech, German, Hungarian, Romanian, and Spanish.</li>
  <li>All language versions were changed to work well with any DPI user chooses
  (see Control Panel: Adjust font size). Many dialogs and their controls
  were enlarged to prevent clipping of contained texts.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Other changes:
  <ul>
  <li>When Salamander is started "As Administrator", it displays "(Administrator)" in main window title just after version.</li>
  <li>Shift+F3: focused file name is selected in Windows Explorer window.</li>
  <li>Completely revamped bug reporting system with minidump support and option to upload report to Altap server.</li>
  <li>Commands Paste (Change Directory) and Change Directory (Shift+F7) trim double quotes (see <a href="https://forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?t=4160">forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?t=4160</a>) and expand environment variables.</li>
  <li>Create Directory: added removing of spaces from beginning and end of specified directory name.</li>
  <li>Compare Directories: compare by content is faster (up to 100%) for large files (more than 5MB) on Windows Vista/7/8/8.1.</li>
  <li>Drive Information: it has displayed incorrect used space and free space for volumes with enabled disk quota.</li>
  <li>User Menu: reading icons for menu items in separate thread, so it does not delay
   start of Open Salamander even if icons are placed on network drives or encrypted
   drives. Reading of these icons have higher priority than reading of icons for invisible
   parts of panels. Until reading of icons is finished, User Menu contains just simple icons
   but you can use it as usual. See <a href="https://forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=6753">forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=6753</a>.</li>
  <li>Copy dialog: if you have "Preserve owners and permissions" as default and
   start copying from FAT32 drive (e.g. USB flash disk), it is no longer
   trying to preserve owners and permissions (it is not supported of FAT32).</li>
  <li>Copy/Move with checked "Overwrite older and skip other existing files without
   asking": speed up when used to copy/move from slow network disk (e.g. from
   virtual private network - VPN) to local disk.</li>
  <li>Copy/Move dialog new option: Ignore alternate data streams (ADS). Use this
   option to remove unwanted ADS from copied files/directories. Use this option
   also when you know copied/moved files and directories do not contain ADS and
   you are copying/moving from slow network disk (e.g. from virtual private
   network - VPN), it can speed up operation drastically, detection of ADS for
   all copied/moved files/directories is very slow.</li>
  <li>If filename contains ':' (impossible on Windows, but possible on unix), Salamander
   reports error instead of working with ADS (Alternate Data Stream).</li>
  <li>Command line parameters -L, -R, and -A can contain paths to archives which
   can be expanded up to 520 chars (long path in archive on long path). Whole
   command line limit is 4096 chars now.</li>
  <li>Fixed missing 'SystemDrive' environment variable that caused problems
   during starting various software (for example Visual Studio *.SLN) 
   from Open Salamander: <a href="https://forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?t=6929&amp;p=26525">forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?t=6929&amp;p=26525</a>.</li>
  <li>Windows 8: fixed broken command Open With invoked from the context menu.
   <a href="https://forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=6730">forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=6730</a> and 
   <a href="https://forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?t=6782">forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?t=6782</a>.</li>
  <li>Paths for left/right/active panel passed in command line parameters
   are expanded (environment variables), it is possible to use %APPDATA%, etc.
   <a href="https://forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=6943">forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=6943</a>.</li>
  <li>Fixed disabled look of "owner draw" buttons.</li>
  <li>Flat progress bars look.</li>
  <li>Using external packer/unpacker on path containing '$' failed due to erroneous
   expansion of initial directory for packer/unpacker.</li>
  <li>Find window: double click and Enter key open focused file or directory (not
   all selected ones as in Explorer). You can still use Open command from right
   click context menu to open all selected files if you need it.</li>
  <li>Fixed environment variables reload problem:
   <a href="https://forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=6188">forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=6188</a>.</li>
  <li>Fixed wrong TortoiseSVN icon placement in Windows XP context menu:
   <a href="https://forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=5627">forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=5627</a>.</li>
  <li>Fixed context menu icons on Windows 7 with DPI > 100%.</li>
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?t=5475">several problems reported</a> in EAP versions.</li>
  <li>x64 Windows and x86 Salamander: Drag&amp;Drop and Copy&amp;Paste from archives or file systems (e.g. FTP) to Explorer is working again (we have added 64-bit shell extension).</li>
  <li>If viewer window is disabled, it does not accept any commands. It has fixed problem with ClipMate. 
      See: <a href="https://forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=7346">forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=7346</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Automation plugin:
  <ul>
  <li>Fixed bug that caused Open Salamander to crash when executing Python scripts.
  See <a href="https://forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=6934">forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=6934</a>.</li>

  <li>Improved plugin stability when using Ruby scripting engine.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Check Version plugin:
  <ul>

</li>
<li>File Comparator plugin:
  <ul>
  <li>If two compared files have the same bytes, File 
  Comparator reports that they are identical. If it just cannot find any difference 
  (all differences are ignored: encoding, white spaces, etc.), it reports only that 
  files appear equal.</li>
  <li>Fixed displaying of long text lines with differences (over 4681 chars).</li>
  <li>Fixed opening File Comparator with fcremote.exe while Salamander window was minimized.</li>
  <li>Small utility for starting File Comparator plugin from the command line, see plugins\filecomp\fcremote.exe.</li>

  <li>Upload of empty file (zero bytes) over encrypted connection (SSL) has
  failed on some FTP servers because our client did not encrypt data-connection
  for empty files. We have fixed it to encrypt all data-connections.
  See <a href="https://forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=6931">forum.altap.cz/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=6931</a>.</li>
