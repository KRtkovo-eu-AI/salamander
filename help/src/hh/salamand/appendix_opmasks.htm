<h1>Operation Masks</h1>
<p>Some Open Salamander operations, such as Copy, Move, or Rename, support
entering of operation mask. Operation mask is appended behind the target path.</p>

<p>Operation masks can contain special characters - asterisk (*) for the rest
of the name or the extension and question mark (?) for a single character.
So the operation mask 'new_*.???' will generate names which begin with 'new_'
followed with the rest of the original name (from the fifth character to the end),
and end with (.) followed with three characters from the original extension.</p>

<p>Operation masks are usually used for simpler operations like changing
extensions in the group of files (you can use '*.html' for renaming .htm files
to .html files, etc.).</p>

<p>If you need more sophisticated renaming or moving, consider using of
<a href="ms-its:renamer.chm::/hh/renamer/introduction_intro.htm">Renamer plugin</a>.
</p>

<h3>Operation Masks Containing More Points</h3>

<p>The mask is divided by the first point (from the left side) to mask for name and
mask for extension. Example: filename is "a.b.c.d" (name is "a.b.c", extension is "d"),
mask is "*.*.old", mask is divided to "*" and "*.old", resulting filename is "a.b.c.d.old"
("a.b.c" + "*" = "a.b.c"; "d" + "*.old" = "d.old").</p>
