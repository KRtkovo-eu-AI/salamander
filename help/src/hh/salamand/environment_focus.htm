<h1>Focusing Item</h1>

<p>The panel can contain any number of items (files and directories) in a list.
If the list contains some items, one of these items is focused. The focused item
is highlighted in the active panel (see <a href="windows_wrkarea.htm">Working Area of Panel</a>
for details). The focused item in inactive panel is not highlighted, but when
the panel becomes active, it is highlighted.
</p>

<p>You can change focus in the list of items (choose another item to be focused).
It can be done using mouse or keyboard. With mouse you can just click the item
you want to focus. The keyboard shortcuts are summarized in the following table.
