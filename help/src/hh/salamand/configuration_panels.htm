<dd>When checked, it tries to detect numbers in names and sort according to the
values of such numbers. E.g. when this is turned on, you will see 2.txt followed by
10.txt (2 is less than 10), if turned off, you'll see 10.txt followed by 2.txt
(character '1' precedes '2').</dd>

<dt><i>Sort by Time order: newer items on top</i></dt>
<dd>When checked and items in panel are sorted by time, items will be sorted in
descending order (newer items on top).</dd>

<dt><i>Sort by Time: sort directories by name</i></dt>
<dd>When checked and items in panel are sorted by time, directories will be sorted
by name (only files are sorted by time).</dd>

<dt><i>Treat directories as if have extensions (also show extensions in Ext column)</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, directories will be sorted as if they have extensions (normally extensions
do not exist in directories names). Moreover directories extensions will be displayed in
separated Ext column (show this column in Configuration/Views). If you want to see the
difference, sort panel by extension.</dd>
