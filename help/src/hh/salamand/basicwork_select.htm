<h1>Selecting Files and Directories</h1>

<p>Almost all file and directory operations (e.g. copying, moving, and deleting)
work with chosen subset of files and directories from active (source) panel. We
talk about this subset as about <i>selected files and directories</i>.
</p>

<p>The list of files and directories in the working area of panel can contain three
types of items - focused item, selected items, and normal items (see
<a href="windows_wrkarea.htm">Working Area of Panel</a> for details). When we talk
about <i>selected files and directories</i>, we mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>all selected items (if any) in the list,</li>
<li>or the focused item, if there are no selected items.</li>
</ul>


<p>We will present here only ways of selecting items in the list (ways of focusing
item are described in <a href="environment_focus.htm">Focusing Item</a>).
</p>

<h3>Selecting Files and Directories Using a Mouse</h3>
<p>There are two modes of using mouse in Open Salamander - classic and single-click modes,
see check box <i>Single-click to open an item</i> in
<a href="configuration_appea.htm">Configuration/Appearance</a>. We present three
tables with functions - for both modes, for classic mode, and for single-click mode.
</p>



<p>
Functions available in both modes of using mouse:
</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th>Function</th>
<th>Shortcuts</th>
<th>Note</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Select or unselect items in the box</td>
<td>Drag or Right Drag optionally with Shift or Ctrl modifier keys</td>
<td>Selects or unselects items as you drag the box over them. To start
this action, you must press (and hold) left or right (no difference) mouse button
behind items in the <a href="windows_wrkarea.htm">working area of panel</a>. It
defines the first corner of the box (the opposite one is dragged by mouse pointer).
If you start dragging without any modifier key, the current selection will be
canceled. If you press (and hold) the Shift or Ctrl modifier key, the current
selection will be kept. With the Shift modifier key all items in the box will
be selected. With the Ctrl modifier key all selected items in the box will be
unselected and vice versa.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Incremental selecting and unselecting</td>
<td>Ctrl+Right Drag or Right Drag</td>
<td>Selects or unselects items as you drag mouse pointer over them. To start this
action, you must press (and hold) right mouse button (and the Ctrl modifier key) on item.
It selects items if this item is unselected and unselects items otherwise.
Use the Ctrl modifier key if you have selected check box <i>Right-click to open shortcut
menu </i> in <a href="configuration_panels.htm">Configuration/Panels</a>.
If you place mouse pointer behind the border of working area of panel, the list of items
in panel will scroll and so allow you to select/unselect also items which are
currently not visible.</td>
