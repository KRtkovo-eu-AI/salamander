<h1>Plugins Concepts</h1>

<p>
Plugins (add-ins) are very popular nowadays. A plugin is an stand-alone module
that adds its services to the application only when these services are needed.
The biggest advantage is the stand-alone feature. Everyone can make his/her
own plugin if the plugins interface is public.  For example someone will make
a plugin for viewing avi files (popular video format) and you'll be able to
easily view avi files directly from Open Salamander - you'll just add this
new plugin to your installed Open Salamander. Another big advantage of the
stand-alone feature is that adding functions doesn't affect the file size of
the main executable. So Open Salamander will start just as fast even when
it contains many new functions (using plugins). Plugins are loaded into memory
only when they are needed and they can be unloaded from memory after use.
