</p>

<h5>Panel Toolbar</h5>
<p>The Panel toolbar contains the most commonly used menu commands connected
with panel. You can right-click change drive button to display context menu

the Directory line to change the directory in the panel.</p>

<h5>Filter Icon</h5>
<p>This icon (<img src="images/filter.gif" width="13" height="10" alt="filter"/>) is
displayed whenever some files or directories existing in the current directory
are not shown in panel. It can be any combination of following reasons:
you are using a filter or you have hidden some selected files or directories
(see <a href="advwork_filter.htm">Limiting the Files and Directories to Display</a>)
or you don't want to see hidden and system files (see
<i>Hide files and directories with hidden or system attribute</i> in
<a href="configuration_panels.htm">Configuration/Panels</a>). Click this icon to open
context menu from which you can suppress described reasons and so display all
existing files and directories.</p>

<h5>List of Working Directories</h5>

to open List of Working Directories.</p>

<h5>Free Space</h5>

<h5>Maximize/Restore Panel</h5>
