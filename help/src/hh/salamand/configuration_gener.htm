<div class="page">

<h1>General</h1>

<p>Allows you to change the general behavior of the Open Salamander.</p>

<h4>Dialog Box Options</h4>
<dl>
<dt><i>Save configuration on exit</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, configuration will be saved on Open Salamander exit. 
Configuration contains settings from Configuration dialog, main window position,
panel widths and current directories, and other options.</dd>

<dt><i>Clear read-only attribute when copying from CD-ROM</i></dt>
<dd>Files on CD-ROM have read-only attribute set. This check box allows clear
this attribute during the copy operation. This is useful for further processing
of these files.</dd>

<dt><i>Allow only one instance of Salamander at one time</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, only one instance if Open Salamander can run. If you try
to start another instance of Open Salamander, the running instance will be
activated instead.</dd>

<dt><i>Use speaker beep to announce finishing of work in inactive window</i></dt>
<dd>Allows you to be notified that operation in inactive window is done.</dd>

<dt><i>Close shell window after command execution (in Command line)</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, command shell will be closed after execution of command in
the Command line. If you execute the command with Alt+Enter key, this setting
for the command will be inverted.</dd>

<dt><i>Compare Directories: ignore time differences up to</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, Compare Directories command will compare files with the specified
time toleration. Use this option to bypass different time accuracy on various file
systems. See <a href="appendix_times.htm">File Times</a> for details.</dd>

<dt><i>Compare Directories: ignore time differences of exactly one or two hours</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, Compare Directories command will ignore time differences of exactly
one or two hours. Such differences can appear because of DST (Daylight Saving Time) and
different ways of storing time informations on various file systems. For example NTFS
uses UTC (after adjusting clocks due to DST all times on NTFS seems to be shifted
because of adjusted conversion of UTC to local time) and FAT32 uses values in local
time zone (there are no shifts due to DST because no conversion to local time is
needed). See <a href="appendix_times.htm">File Times</a> for details.</dd>

<dt><i>Open files through salopen.exe (it bypasses shell extensions errors)</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, execution of files in the panel will be carried through
small program salopen.exe. This option can be useful when directories where you
have opened files could not be possible to delete.</dd>

<dt><i>Select also filename extension in Quick Rename and Pack commands</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, whole name including extension will be initially selected when entering
new filename in the Quick Rename or Pack dialog boxes. Otherwise, only name part will be 
selected. You can use the Ctrl+A keyboard shortcut to select all.
</dd>

<dt><i>Select also filename extension in Edit New File command</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, whole name including extension will be initially selected when entering
new filename in the Edit New File dialog box. Otherwise, only name part will be 
selected. You can use the Ctrl+A keyboard shortcut to select all.
</dd>

<dt><i>Use fast directory move on Novell Netware</i></dt>
<dd>When checked and you are moving directory in scope of one Novell Netware drive,
Salamander moves this directory just by renaming it directly to the target path
(it is fast but not always working). Otherwise, Salamander renames only files, all
necessary directories are created on target path and after moving contained files
deleted in source directory (it can be much slower but always working). We recommend
you to try turn on this option and turn it off only when moving of directories in
scope of one Novell Netware drive fails.
</dd>

<dt><i>Copy files: use faster asynchronous algorithm on network (Windows 7 and later)</i></dt>
<dd>When checked and you are copying files to or from network drive, Salamander uses
asynchronous copy algorithm which is faster then conventional one (111 MB/s on GLAN
instead of 86 MB/s). This advanced algorithm is available only on Windows 7 and later.
Otherwise, Salamander copies files using conventional algorithm. This option affects
also moving of files in case you are not moving in scope of one volume (then it is
just rename, not copy and delete). Asynchronous copy algorithm is also optimized for
network drives accessible via VPN (Virtual Private Network). It uses smaller blocks
(size depends on current copy speed), so progress is smoother and you can cancel operation
instantly.
</dd>

<dt><i>Keep environment variables updated to system values</i></dt>
<dd>When checked, Salamander reads system environment variables on start and when 
system environment variables are changed. Values of environment variables inherited
from parent process are overwritten by values from system. Variables which do not
exist in system remain untouched. Uncheck this option to use inherited environment
variables in running Salamander and all processes started from it.</dd>
