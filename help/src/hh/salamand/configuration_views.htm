<h1>Views</h1>
    
<p>Allows you to define content of the Open Salamander panels.</p>

<h4>Dialog Box Options</h4>
<dl>
<dt><i>Defined Views</i></dt>
<dd>Lists all of defined views. Details of selected view are displayed in the
rest of this dialog. You can rename (the F2 key), delete (the Delete key),
and change position (the Alt+Down or Up Arrow key) of views in this list.
Use toolbar above list or keyboard shortcuts.</dd>

<dt><i>Available Columns</i></dt>
<dd>Contains list of all columns in the selected view. Check the columns you
want to see. This list is disabled when no named view is selected or type of
selected view is not detailed.</dd>

<dt><i>Fixed column width in left/right panel</i></dt>
<dd>Only for detailed views. When checked, fixed width of selected column in
left/right panel can be set (usually it's set by dragging column right edge
in the Header line). Otherwise it will be automatically calculated to fit the
longest value in the column. You can change the column to fixed/automatic width
also using Automatic Column Width item in right-click context menu on column
header in the Header line.</dd>

<dt><i>Set smart mode: Left/Right panel</i></dt>
<dd>Only for detailed views. When checked and the Name column has not fixed
width (previous option must be turned off), it tries to narrow the Name column
(if needed) to reduce horizontal scrolling in panel. It helps in situations
when you have few files with very long names which cause that other columns
are displayed far on the right side (often behind panel right edge, so you
must scroll to the right to see values in these columns). You can turn on/off
smart mode using the Ctrl+N key in panel. Or using Smart Column Mode item in
right-click context menu on Name column header in the Header line.</dd>
