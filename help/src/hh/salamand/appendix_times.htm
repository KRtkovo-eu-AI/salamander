<h1>File and Directory Times</h1>

<p><i>Coordinated universal time (UTC)</i> is the standard international time
used internally by the system. UTC is loosely defined as the current date and
time of day in Greenwich, England. This time is called also <i>Greenwich mean
time (GMT)</i>.</p>

<p><i>Local time</i> is the date and time of day for your time zone. The current
time-zone settings control how the system converts between UTC and local time.</p>

<p>A file time represents the specific date and time at which a specified file
was created, last accessed, or last written to. The system records file times
whenever applications create, access, and write to files. The system records
the times using a 64-bit value specifying the number of 100-nanosecond intervals
that have elapsed since 12:00 A.M. January 1, 1601 (UTC). Writing to a file
changes the last write time; writing to or reading from the file (including
running an executable file) changes the last access time.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> Not all file systems can record creation and last
access time and not all file systems record them in the same manner. For
example, on Windows NT FAT, create time has a resolution of 10 milliseconds,
write time has a resolution of 2 seconds, and access time has a resolution
of 1 day (really, the access date). On NTFS, access time has a resolution of
1 hour. Furthermore, FAT records times on disk in local time, while NTFS records
times on disk in UTC, so it is not affected by changes in time zone or daylight
saving time.</p>
