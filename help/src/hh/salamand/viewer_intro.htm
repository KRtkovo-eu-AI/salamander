<h1>Introduction to Internal Viewer</h1>

<p>The aim of the Internal Viewer is to display any file as fast as possible
in Text or Hex view mode. It reads only parts of the file which are displayed
or used for calculation of vertical scroll limit. It means that you can view
200 GB file with the same speed as 200 KB file (assuming that it will display
the same part of both files).</p>

<p>You can use the Internal Viewer to: view a file content as text (the Text view
mode) or as hexadecimal values (the Hex view mode); search for text or match
regular expressions; copy blocks of text to the clipboard or to disk; convert
text to chosen code page; and other tasks.</p>
