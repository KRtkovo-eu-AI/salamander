<h1>File and Directory Attributes</h1>
<p>Several characteristics called attributes may be associated with a file or directory.
The attributes can be one or more of the following values.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<th>Attribute</th><th>Symbol</th><th>Meaning</th>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>Archive</td>
 <td>A</td>
 <td>The file or directory is an archive file. Applications use this attribute
     to mark files for backup or removal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Compressed</td>
 <td>C</td>
 <td>The file or directory is compressed (only on NTFS volumes). For a file, this means that all of the
     data in the file is compressed. For a directory, this means that compression
     is the default for newly created files and subdirectories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Encrypted</td>
 <td>E</td>
 <td>The file or directory is encrypted (only on NTFS volumes). For a file, this means that all of the
     data in the file is encrypted. For a directory, this means that all newly
     created files and subdirectories will be encrypted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Hidden</td>
 <td>H</td>                                  
 <td>The file or directory is hidden. It is not included in an ordinary directory
     listing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Offline</td>
 <td>O</td>
 <td>The data of the file is not immediately available. This attribute indicates that the file data 
     has been physically moved to offline storage. This attribute is used by Remote Storage, the 
     hierarchical storage management software.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Read-only</td>
 <td>R</td>
 <td>The file or directory is read-only. Applications can read the file but cannot
     write to it or delete it. In the case of a directory, applications cannot
     delete it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>System</td>
 <td>S</td>
 <td>The file or directory is part of the operating system or is used exclusively
     by the operating system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Temporary</td>
 <td>T</td>
 <td>The file is being used for temporary storage. File systems attempt to keep all 
     of the data in memory for quicker access rather than flushing the data back to 
     mass storage.</td>
</tr>
