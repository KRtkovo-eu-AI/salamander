<h1>B</h1>

<h4 class="glossary">bit</h4>
<p>The smallest unit of information handled by a computer. One bit expresses a 1
or a 0 in a binary numeral, or a true or false logical condition. A group of 8 bits
makes up a byte, which can represent many types of information, such as a letter
of the alphabet, a decimal digit, or other character. Bit is also called binary
digit.</p>

<h4 class="glossary">bits per second (bps)</h4>
<p>The number of bits transmitted every second, used as a measure of the speed at
which a device, such as a modem, can transfer data. A character is made up of 8
bits. In asynchronous communication, each character is preceded by a start bit
and terminates with a stop bit. So for each character, 10 bits are transmitted.
If a modem communicates at 2,400 bits per second (bps), then 240 characters are
sent every second.</p>
 
<h4 class="glossary">brief mode</h4>

icon with a label to the right of it. Items are arranged in columns. See also
