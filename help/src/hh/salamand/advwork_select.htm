<h1>Saving and Loading Selection</h1>

<p>Saving selection allows to use the selection again in the same directory or in
a different directory. The selection is saved to a selection memory (only for use
inside Salamander) or to the clipboard (it is saved as plain text, so you can use
it in text editors, etc.). The saved selection can be used in both panels.</p>

<p>When you want to use a previously saved selection, you can load the selection
into the panel. The current selection in panel can be canceled or kept. If you
want to keep it, you can add, subtract, or make intersection with the loaded
selection.</p>

<h3>To save selection:</h3>
<table>
<tr><td class="hdr">Menu:</td><td>Edit/Advanced/Save Selection</td></tr>
<tr><td class="hdr">Shortcut key:</td><td>Ctrl+Shift+F5</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>To load selection:</h3>
<table>
<tr><td class="hdr">Menu:</td><td>Edit/Advanced/Load Selection</td></tr>
<tr><td class="hdr">Shortcut key:</td><td>Ctrl+Shift+F6</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>These commands are handy if you want to make a couple of operations
(e.g. convert character set or line ends, change case of names, and
pack to archive) on chosen subset of files and directories (each
operation removes selection, so you need to restore selection before
next operation, see also Restore Selection in
<a href="basicwork_select.htm">Selecting Files and Directories</a>).
You can use these commands also when you compare
two directories and need to select same files and directories in
both panels (e.g. to compare their total sizes or to see if they all
exist in both panels - if not, numbers of selected items in panels
will be different).</p>
